ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND Lewis Carroll CHAPTER I
Down the
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it what is the use of a book thought Alice pictures or conversations
So she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her

There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself dear
Oh dear
I shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS and looked at it and then hurried on Alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large under the hedge

In another moment down went Alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again

The went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well

Either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next
First she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs
She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it

thought Alice to herself such a fall as this I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs
How brave all think me at home
Why I say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house Which was very likely true

Down down down
Would the fall NEVER come to an end
wonder how many miles fallen by this time she said aloud
must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth
Let me see that would be four thousand miles down I think for you see Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes about the right distance but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude got to Alice had no idea what Latitude was or Longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say

Presently she began again
wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth
How funny seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward
The Antipathies I think she was rather glad there WAS no one listening this time as it sound at all the right word but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know
Please is this New Zealand or Australia and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy CURTSEYING as falling through the air
Do you think you could manage it
what an ignorant little girl think me for asking
No never do to ask perhaps I shall see it written up
Down down down
There was nothing else to do so Alice soon began talking again
miss me very much I should think Dinah was the cat
hope remember her saucer of milk at
Dinah my dear
I wish you were down here with me
There are no mice in the air afraid but you might catch a bat and very like a mouse you know
But do cats eat bats I wonder And here Alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way cats eat bats
Do cats eat bats and sometimes bats eat cats for you see as she answer either question it much matter which way she put it
She felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah and saying to her very earnestly Dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump
thump
down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over

Alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it
There was not a moment to be lost away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner my ears and whiskers how late getting She was close behind it when she turned the corner but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof

There were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again

Suddenly she came upon a little table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas
either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them
However on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw
How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway even if my head would go through thought poor Alice would be of very little use without my shoulders
Oh how I wish I could shut up like a telescope
I think I could if I only knew how to For you see so many things had happened lately that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it certainly was not here before said Alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words beautifully printed on it in large letters

It was all very well to say me but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry
look first she said see whether marked or for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later

However this bottle was NOT marked so Alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of custard roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off




a curious feeling said Alice must be shutting up like a
And so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden
First however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this it might end you know said Alice to herself my going out altogether like a candle
I wonder what I should be like then And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing

After a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor Alice
when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried

no use in crying like that said Alice to herself rather sharply advise you to leave off this minute She generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people
no use now thought poor Alice pretend to be two people
Why hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words were beautifully marked in currants
eat it said Alice if it makes me grow larger I can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller I can creep under the door so either way get into the garden and I care which happens
She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself way
Which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way

So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake





CHAPTER II
The Pool of Tears
and curiouser cried Alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English opening out like the largest telescope that ever was
feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off
my poor little feet I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears
sure be able
I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can but I must be kind to them thought Alice perhaps they walk the way I want to go
Let me see give them a new pair of boots every
And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it
must go by the carrier she thought how funny seem sending presents to own feet
And how odd the directions will look

RIGHT FOOT ESQ
HEARTHRUG NEAR THE FENDER WITH LOVE

Oh dear what nonsense talking
Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door

Poor Alice
It was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again

ought to be ashamed of yourself said Alice great girl like you she might well say this go on crying in this way
Stop this moment I tell you But she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall

After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming
It was the White Rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came
the Duchess the Duchess
Oh
she be savage if kept her waiting Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the Rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice you please sir The Rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go

Alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear
How queer everything is
And yesterday things went on just as usual
I wonder if been changed in the night
Let me think was I the same when I got up this morning
I almost think I can remember feeling a little different
But if not the same the next question is Who in the world am I
Ah the great puzzle And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them

sure not Ada she said her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine go in ringlets at all and sure I be Mabel for I know all sorts of things and she oh
she knows such a very little
Besides she and I and oh dear how puzzling it all is
try if I know all the things I used to know
Let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is oh dear
I shall never get to twenty at that rate
However the Multiplication Table signify try Geography
London is the capital of Paris and Paris is the capital of Rome and Rome no all wrong certain
I must have been changed for Mabel
try and say doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do
doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale

cheerfully he seems to grin How neatly spread his claws And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws
sure those are not the right words said poor Alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on must be Mabel after all and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh
ever so many lessons to learn
No made up my mind about it if Mabel stay down here
be no use their putting their heads down and saying up again dear I shall only look up and say am I then
Tell me that first and then if I like being that person come up if not stay down here till somebody but oh dear cried Alice with a sudden burst of tears do wish they WOULD put their heads down
I am so VERY tired of being all alone here
As she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the little white kid gloves while she was talking
CAN I have done that she thought
must be growing small She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether

WAS a narrow escape said Alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas
the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before things are worse than ever thought the poor child I never was so small as this before never
And I declare too bad that it is
As she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash
she was up to her chin in salt water
Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea in that case I can go back by railway she said to herself
Alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station
However she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high

wish I cried so much said Alice as she swam about trying to find her way out
shall be punished for it now I suppose by being drowned in my own tears
That WILL be a queer thing to be sure
However everything is queer
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself

it be of any use now thought Alice speak to this mouse
Everything is so down here that I should think very likely it can talk at any rate no harm in So she began Mouse do you know the way out of this pool
I am very tired of swimming about here O Mouse Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her Latin Grammar mouse of a mouse to a mouse a mouse O mouse The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing

it understand English thought Alice daresay a French mouse come over with William the For with all her knowledge of history Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened
So she began again est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her French
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright
I beg your pardon cried Alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor feelings
quite forgot you like
like cats cried the Mouse in a shrill passionate voice
YOU like cats if you were me
perhaps not said Alice in a soothing tone be angry about it
And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah I think take a fancy to cats if you could only see her
She is such a dear quiet thing Alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and such a capital one for catching mice oh I beg your pardon cried Alice again for this time the Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
talk about her any more if rather
indeed cried the Mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail
if I would talk on such a subject
Our family always HATED cats nasty low vulgar things
let me hear the name again
indeed said Alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation
you are you fond of of dogs The Mouse did not answer so Alice went on eagerly is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you
A little terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair
And fetch things when you throw them and sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of things I remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says so useful worth a hundred pounds
He says it kills all the rats and oh dear cried Alice in a sorrowful tone afraid offended it again For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went

So she called softly after it dear
Do come back again and we talk about cats or dogs either if you like them When the Mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion Alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice us get to the shore and then tell you my history and understand why it is I hate cats and
It was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a Duck and a Dodo a Lory and an Eaglet and several other curious creatures
Alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore


CHAPTER III
A and a Long Tale
They were indeed a party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable

The first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life
Indeed she had quite a long argument with the Lory who at last turned sulky and would only say am older than you and must know and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the Lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said

At last the Mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out down all of you and listen to me
soon make you dry enough They all sat down at once in a large ring with the Mouse in the middle
Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon

said the Mouse with an important air you all ready
This is the driest thing I know
Silence all round if you please
the Conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the English who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest
Edwin and Morcar the earls of Mercia and Northumbria
said the Lory with a shiver

beg your pardon said the Mouse frowning but very politely you speak
I said the Lory hastily

thought you did said the Mouse
I proceed
and Morcar the earls of Mercia and Northumbria declared for him and even Stigand the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury found it advisable
WHAT said the Duck

IT the Mouse replied rather crossly course you know what
know what means well enough when I find a thing said the Duck generally a frog or a worm
The question is what did the archbishop find
The Mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown
conduct at first was moderate
But the insolence of his Normans How are you getting on now my dear it continued turning to Alice as it spoke

wet as ever said Alice in a melancholy tone seem to dry me at
that case said the Dodo solemnly rising to its feet move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies
English said the Eaglet
know the meaning of half those long words and more I believe you do either And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly

I was going to say said the Dodo in an offended tone that the best thing to get us dry would be a
IS a said Alice not that she wanted much to know but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything

said the Dodo best way to explain it is to do And as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day I will tell you how the Dodo managed it

First it marked out a in a sort of circle exact shape matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there
There was no two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over
However when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the Dodo suddenly called out race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking who has won
This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see Shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence
At last the Dodo said has won and all must have
who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked

SHE of course said the Dodo pointing to Alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way
Prizes
Alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes
There was exactly one all round

she must have a prize herself you know said the Mouse

course the Dodo replied very gravely
else have you got in your pocket he went on turning to Alice

a thimble said Alice sadly

it over here said the Dodo

Then they all crowded round her once more while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying beg your acceptance of this elegant and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered

Alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could

The next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back
However it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more

promised to tell me your history you know said Alice why it is you hate C and D she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again

is a long and a sad tale said the Mouse turning to Alice and sighing

IS a long tail certainly said Alice looking down with wonder at the tail why do you call it sad And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this
said to a mouse That he met in the house us both go to law I will prosecute Come take no denial We must have a trial For really this morning nothing to Said the mouse to the cur a trial dear Sir With no jury or judge would be wasting our be judge be jury Said cunning old Fury try the whole cause and condemn you to
are not attending said the Mouse to Alice severely
are you thinking of
beg your pardon said Alice very humbly had got to the fifth bend I think
had NOT cried the Mouse sharply and very angrily

knot said Alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her
do let me help to undo it
shall do nothing of the sort said the Mouse getting up and walking away
insult me by talking such nonsense
mean it pleaded poor Alice
so easily offended you know
The Mouse only growled in reply

come back and finish your story Alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus please do but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker

a pity it stay sighed the Lory as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter my dear
Let this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper your tongue Ma said the young Crab a little snappishly
enough to try the patience of an oyster
wish I had our Dinah here I know I do said Alice aloud addressing nobody in particular
soon fetch it back
who is Dinah if I might venture to ask the question said the Lory

Alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet our cat
And such a capital one for catching mice you think
And oh I wish you could see her after the birds
Why eat a little bird as soon as look at it
This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party
Some of the birds hurried off at once one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking really must be getting home the suit my throat and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children away my dears
high time you were all in bed On various pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone

wish I mentioned Dinah she said to herself in a melancholy tone
seems to like her down here and sure the best cat in the world
Oh my dear Dinah
I wonder if I shall ever see you any more And here poor Alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and
In a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story


CHAPTER IV
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
It was the White Rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself Duchess
The Duchess
Oh my dear paws
Oh my fur and whiskers
get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets
Where CAN I have dropped them I wonder Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone Mary Ann what ARE you doing out here
Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan
Quick now And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made

took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran
surprised be when he finds out who I am
But better take him his fan and gloves that is if I can find As she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name
engraved upon it
She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves

queer it seems Alice said to herself be going messages for a rabbit
I suppose be sending me on messages next And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen Alice
Come here directly and get ready for your walk in a minute nurse
But got to see that the mouse get Only I think Alice went on let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that
By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the
There was no label this time with the words ME but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips
know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen she said to herself I eat or drink anything so just see what this bottle does
I do hope make me grow large again for really quite tired of being such a tiny little thing
It did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken
She hastily put down the bottle saying to herself quite enough I hope I grow any more As it is I get out at the door I do wish I drunk quite so much
Alas
it was too late to wish that
She went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head
Still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself I can do no more whatever happens
What WILL become of me
Luckily for Alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy

was much pleasanter at home thought poor Alice one always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits
I almost wish I gone down that and yet and yet rather curious you know this sort of life
I do wonder what CAN have happened to me
When I used to read I fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here I am in the middle of one
There ought to be a book written about me that there ought
And when I grow up write one but grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone least no room to grow up any more
then thought Alice I NEVER get any older than I am now
be a comfort one way never to be an old woman but then always to have lessons to learn
Oh I like THAT
you foolish Alice she answered herself
can you learn lessons in here
Why hardly room for YOU and no room at all for any
And so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen

Ann
Mary Ann said the voice
me my gloves this moment Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs
Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure
Alice heard it say to itself go round and get in at the
you thought Alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air
She did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a or something of the sort

Next came an angry voice the
Pat
Where are you And then a voice she had never heard before then here
Digging for apples yer honour
for apples indeed said the Rabbit angrily

Come and help me out of THIS Sounds of more broken glass

tell me Pat that in the window
an arm yer honour He pronounced it
arm you goose
Who ever saw one that size
Why it fills the whole window
it does yer honour but an arm for all
got no business there at any rate go and take it away
There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then such as I like it yer honour at all at all as I tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air
This time there were TWO little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass
a number of there must be thought Alice
wonder what do next
As for pulling me out of the window I only wish they COULD
sure I want to stay in here any longer
She waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words the other ladder Why I to bring but one got the other Bill
fetch it here lad Here put up at this corner No tie together first they reach half high enough yet Oh
do well enough be particular Here Bill
catch hold of this rope Will the roof bear Mind that loose slate Oh coming down
Heads below a loud crash who did that It was Bill I fancy to go down the chimney Nay I
YOU do it That I then to go down Here Bill
the master says to go down the chimney

So got to come down the chimney has he said Alice to herself
they seem to put everything upon Bill
I be in place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but I THINK I can kick a little
She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself is Bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next

The first thing she heard was a general chorus of goes Bill then the voice along him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices up his head Brandy now choke him How was it old fellow
What happened to you
Tell us all about it
Last came a little feeble squeaking voice Bill thought Alice I hardly know No more thank ye better now but a deal too flustered to tell you all I know is something comes at me like a and up I goes like a
you did old fellow said the others

must burn the house down said the voice and Alice called out as loud as she could you do
set Dinah at you
There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to herself wonder what they WILL do next
If they had any sense take the roof After a minute or two they began moving about again and Alice heard the Rabbit say barrowful will do to begin
barrowful of WHAT thought Alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face
put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out better not do that again which produced another dead silence

Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head
I eat one of these cakes she thought sure to make SOME change in my size and as it possibly make me larger it must make me smaller I
So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly
As soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside
The poor little Lizard Bill was in the middle being held up by two who were giving it something out of a bottle
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood

first thing got to do said Alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden
I think that will be the best
It sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry

An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her
little thing said Alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing

Hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then Alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then Alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the bark sounded quite faint in the distance

yet what a dear little puppy it was said Alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves should have liked teaching it tricks very much if if only been the right size to do it
Oh dear
nearly forgotten that got to grow up again
Let me see how IS it to be managed
I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what
The great question certainly was what
Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances
There was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it

She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else


CHAPTER Advice from a Caterpillar
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice

are YOU said the Caterpillar

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation
Alice replied rather shyly I hardly know sir just at present at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning but I think I must have been changed several times since
do you mean by that said the Caterpillar sternly
yourself
explain MYSELF afraid said Alice not myself you
see said the Caterpillar

afraid I put it more clearly Alice replied very politely I understand it myself to begin with and being so many different sizes in a day is very
said the Caterpillar

perhaps you found it so yet said Alice when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day you know and then after that into a butterfly I should think feel it a little queer you
a bit said the Caterpillar

perhaps your feelings may be different said Alice I know is it would feel very queer to
said the Caterpillar contemptuously
are YOU
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation
Alice felt a little irritated at the making such VERY short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely think you ought to tell me who YOU are
said the Caterpillar

Here was another puzzling question and as Alice could not think of any good reason and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant state of mind she turned away

back the Caterpillar called after her
something important to say
This sounded promising certainly Alice turned and came back again

your temper said the Caterpillar

that all said Alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could

said the Caterpillar

Alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing
For some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said you think changed do you
afraid I am sir said Alice remember things as I used and I keep the same size for ten minutes together
remember WHAT things said the Caterpillar

tried to say DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE but it all came different Alice replied in a very melancholy voice

ARE OLD FATHER WILLIAM said the Caterpillar

Alice folded her hands and began
are old Father William the young man said your hair has become very white And yet you incessantly stand on your head Do you think at your age it is right
my youth Father William replied to his son feared it might injure the brain But now that perfectly sure I have none Why I do it again and
are old said the youth I mentioned before And have grown most uncommonly fat Yet you turned a in at the door Pray what is the reason of that
my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment one shilling the box Allow me to sell you a couple
are old said the youth your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet Yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak Pray how did you manage to do it
my youth said his father took to the law And argued each case with my wife And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw Has lasted the rest of my
are old said the youth would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose What made you so awfully clever
have answered three questions and that is enough Said his father give yourself airs
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff
Be off or kick you down stairs
is not said right said the Caterpillar

QUITE right afraid said Alice timidly of the words have got
is wrong from beginning to end said the Caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes

The Caterpillar was the first to speak

size do you want to be it asked

not particular as to size Alice hastily replied one like changing so often you
know said the Caterpillar

Alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper

you content now said the Caterpillar

I should like to be a LITTLE larger sir if you mind said Alice inches is such a wretched height to
is a very good height indeed said the Caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high

not used to it pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone
And she thought of herself wish the creatures be so easily offended
get used to it in time said the Caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself
Then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow
side of WHAT
The other side of WHAT thought Alice to herself

the mushroom said the Caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question
However at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand

now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit
Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit




my free at last said Alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her

CAN all that green stuff be said Alice
where HAVE my shoulders got to
And oh my poor hands how is it I see you She was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves

As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent
She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings

screamed the Pigeon

NOT a serpent said Alice indignantly
me alone
I say again repeated the Pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob tried every way and nothing seems to suit them
the least idea what talking about said Alice

tried the roots of trees and tried banks and tried hedges the Pigeon went on without attending to her those serpents
no pleasing them
Alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished

if it trouble enough hatching the eggs said the Pigeon I must be on the for serpents night and day
Why I had a wink of sleep these three weeks
very sorry been annoyed said Alice who was beginning to see its meaning

just as taken the highest tree in the wood continued the Pigeon raising its voice to a shriek just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky
Ugh Serpent
NOT a serpent I tell you said Alice
a a

WHAT are you said the Pigeon
can see trying to invent something
a little girl said Alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day

likely story indeed said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt
seen a good many little girls in my time but never ONE with such a neck as that
No no
a serpent and no use denying it
I suppose be telling me next that you never tasted an egg
HAVE tasted eggs certainly said Alice who was a very truthful child little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you
believe it said the Pigeon if they do why then a kind of serpent all I can
This was such a new idea to Alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding looking for eggs I know THAT well enough and what does it matter to me whether a little girl or a serpent
matters a good deal to ME said Alice hastily not looking for eggs as it happens and if I was I want YOURS I like them
be off then said the Pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest
Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it
After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height

It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual
half my plan done now
How puzzling all these changes are
never sure what going to be from one minute to another
However got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful garden how IS that to be done I wonder As she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high
lives there thought Alice never do to come upon them THIS size why I should frighten them out of their wits So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high


CHAPTER VI
Pig and Pepper
For a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles
It was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen Alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads
She felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen

The began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone the Duchess
An invitation from the Queen to play The repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little the Queen
An invitation for the Duchess to play
Then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together

Alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky

Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked

no sort of use in knocking said the Footman that for two reasons
First because on the same side of the door as you are secondly because making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces

then said Alice am I to get in
might be some sense in your knocking the Footman went on without attending to her we had the door between us
For instance if you were INSIDE you might knock and I could let you out you He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil
perhaps he help it she said to herself eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head
But at any rate he might answer How am I to get in she repeated aloud

shall sit here the Footman remarked tomorrow
At this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him

or next day maybe the Footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened

am I to get in asked Alice again in a louder tone

you to get in at all said the Footman
the first question you
It was no doubt only Alice did not like to be told so
really dreadful she muttered to herself way all the creatures argue
enough to drive one crazy
The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations
shall sit here he said and off for days and
what am I to do said Alice

you like said the Footman and began whistling

no use in talking to him said Alice desperately perfectly idiotic And she opened the door and went in

The door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the Duchess was sitting on a stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup

certainly too much pepper in that soup Alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing

There was certainly too much of it in the air
Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a pause
The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear

would you tell me said Alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first your cat grins like that
a Cheshire cat said the Duchess why
Pig
She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again
know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact I know that cats COULD
all can said the Duchess most of
know of any that do Alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation

know much said the Duchess a
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation
While she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby the came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes
The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not

PLEASE mind what doing cried Alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror
there goes his PRECIOUS as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off

everybody minded their own business the Duchess said in a hoarse growl world would go round a deal faster than it
would NOT be an advantage said Alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge
think of what work it would make with the day and night
You see the earth takes hours to turn round on its axis
of axes said the Duchess off her head
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again hours I THINK or is it twelve
I
bother ME said the Duchess never could abide figures And with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line
roughly to your little boy And beat him when he sneezes He only does it to annoy Because he knows it
CHORUS

In which the cook and the baby joined

wow
wow
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that Alice could hardly hear the words
speak severely to my boy I beat him when he sneezes For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases
CHORUS


wow
wow

you may nurse it a bit if you like the Duchess said to Alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke
must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen and she hurried out of the room
The cook threw a after her as she went out but it just missed her

Alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions like a thought Alice
The poor little thing was snorting like a when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it

As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air
I take this child away with me thought Alice sure to kill it in a day or two it be murder to leave it behind She said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time
grunt said Alice not at all a proper way of expressing
The baby grunted again and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it
There could be no doubt that it had a VERY nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all
perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears

No there were no tears
going to turn into a pig my dear said Alice seriously have nothing more to do with you
Mind now The poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence

Alice was just beginning to think to herself what am I to do with this creature when I get it home when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm
This time there could be NO mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further

So she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood
it had grown up she said to herself would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig I And she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself one only knew the right way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice
It looked she thought still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect

Puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider
pleased so far thought Alice and she went on
you tell me please which way I ought to go from here
depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the Cat

much care where said Alice

it matter which way you go said the Cat

so long as I get SOMEWHERE Alice added as an explanation

sure to do that said the Cat you only walk long
Alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question
sort of people live about here
THAT direction the Cat said waving its right paw round a Hatter and in THAT direction waving the other paw a March Hare
Visit either you like both
I want to go among mad people Alice remarked

you help that said the Cat all mad here
mad

do you know mad said Alice

must be said the Cat you have come
Alice think that proved it at all however she went on how do you know that mad
begin with said the Cat not mad
You grant that
suppose so said Alice

then the Cat went on see a dog growls when angry and wags its tail when pleased
Now I growl when pleased and wag my tail when angry
Therefore
call it purring not growling said Alice

it what you like said the Cat
you play croquet with the Queen
should like it very much said Alice I been invited
see me there said the Cat and vanished

Alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening
While she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again

what became of the baby said the Cat
nearly forgotten to
turned into a pig Alice quietly said just as if it had come back in a natural way

thought it would said the Cat and vanished again

Alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live
seen hatters before she said to herself March Hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is May it be raving mad at least not so mad as it was in As she said this she looked up and there was the Cat again sitting on a branch of a tree

you say pig or fig said the Cat

said pig replied Alice I wish you keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite
right said the Cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone


often seen a cat without a grin thought Alice a grin without a cat
the most curious thing I ever saw in my life
She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur
It was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself it should be raving mad after all
I almost wish gone to see the Hatter instead

CHAPTER VII
A Mad
There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it a Dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head
uncomfortable for the Dormouse thought Alice as asleep I suppose it
The table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it room
No room they cried out when they saw Alice coming
PLENTY of room said Alice indignantly and she sat down in a large at one end of the table

some wine the March Hare said in an encouraging tone

Alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea
see any wine she remarked

any said the March Hare

it very civil of you to offer it said Alice angrily

very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the March Hare

know it was YOUR table said Alice laid for a great many more than
hair wants cutting said the Hatter
He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech

should learn not to make personal remarks Alice said with some severity very
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he SAID was is a raven like a
we shall have some fun now thought Alice
glad begun asking I believe I can guess that she added aloud

you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the March Hare

so said Alice

you should say what you mean the March Hare went on

do Alice hastily replied least at least I mean what I say the same thing you
the same thing a bit said the Hatter
might just as well say that see what I is the same thing as eat what I
might just as well say added the March Hare like what I is the same thing as get what I
might just as well say added the Dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep breathe when I is the same thing as sleep when I
IS the same thing with you said the Hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and which much

The Hatter was the first to break the silence
day of the month is it he said turning to Alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear

Alice considered a little and then said
days wrong sighed the Hatter
told you butter suit the works he added looking angrily at the March Hare

was the BEST butter the March Hare meekly replied

but some crumbs must have got in as well the Hatter grumbled have put it in with the
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark was the BEST butter you
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity
a funny watch she remarked
tells the day of the month and tell what it is
should it muttered the Hatter
YOUR watch tell you what year it is
course not Alice replied very readily because it stays the same year for such a long time
is just the case with MINE said the Hatter

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled
The remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly English
quite understand you she said as politely as she could

Dormouse is asleep again said the Hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose

The Dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes course of course just what I was going to remark
you guessed the riddle yet the Hatter said turning to Alice again

I give it up Alice replied the answer
the slightest idea said the Hatter

I said the March Hare

Alice sighed wearily
think you might do something better with the time she said waste it in asking riddles that have no
you knew Time as well as I do said the Hatter talk about wasting IT

know what you mean said Alice

course you the Hatter said tossing his head contemptuously
dare say you never even spoke to Time
not Alice cautiously replied I know I have to beat time when I learn

that accounts for it said the Hatter
stand beating
Now if you only kept on good terms with him do almost anything you liked with the clock
For instance suppose it were nine in the morning just time to begin lessons only have to whisper a hint to Time and round goes the clock in a twinkling
one time for dinner
only wish it was the March Hare said to itself in a whisper

would be grand certainly said Alice thoughtfully then I be hungry for it you
at first perhaps said the Hatter you could keep it to one as long as you
that the way YOU manage Alice asked

The Hatter shook his head mournfully
I he replied
quarrelled last March just before HE went mad you know pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts and I had to sing
twinkle little bat
How I wonder what at
You know the song perhaps
heard something like it said Alice

goes on you know the Hatter continued this way
above the world you fly Like a in the sky
Twinkle twinkle
Here the Dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop

hardly finished the first verse said the Hatter the Queen jumped up and bawled out murdering the time
Off with his head
dreadfully savage exclaimed Alice

ever since that the Hatter went on in a mournful tone do a thing I ask
always six
A bright idea came into head
that the reason so many are put out here she asked

it said the Hatter with a sigh always and no time to wash the things between
you keep moving round I suppose said Alice

so said the Hatter the things get used
what happens when you come to the beginning again Alice ventured to ask

we change the subject the March Hare interrupted yawning
getting tired of this
I vote the young lady tells us a
afraid I know one said Alice rather alarmed at the proposal

the Dormouse shall they both cried
up Dormouse And they pinched it on both sides at once

The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes
asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice heard every word you fellows were
us a story said the March Hare

please do pleaded Alice

be quick about it added the Hatter be asleep again before
upon a time there were three little sisters the Dormouse began in a great hurry their names were Elsie Lacie and Tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well
did they live on said Alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking

lived on treacle said the Dormouse after thinking a minute or two

have done that you know Alice gently remarked have been
they were said the Dormouse
Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on why did they live at the bottom of a well
some more tea the March Hare said to Alice very earnestly

had nothing yet Alice replied in an offended tone I take
mean you take LESS said the Hatter very easy to take MORE than
asked YOUR opinion said Alice

making personal remarks now the Hatter asked triumphantly

Alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and and then turned to the Dormouse and repeated her question
did they live at the bottom of a well
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said was a
no such thing Alice was beginning very angrily but the Hatter and the March Hare went
sh and the Dormouse sulkily remarked you be civil better finish the story for
please go on Alice said very humbly interrupt again
I dare say there may be
indeed said the Dormouse indignantly
However he consented to go on
so these three little sisters they were learning to draw you know
did they draw said Alice quite forgetting her promise

said the Dormouse without considering at all this time

want a clean cup interrupted the Hatter all move one place
He moved on as he spoke and the Dormouse followed him the March Hare moved into the place and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare
The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and Alice was a good deal worse off than before as the March Hare had just upset the into his plate

Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again so she began very cautiously I understand
Where did they draw the treacle from
can draw water out of a said the Hatter I should think you could draw treacle out of a eh stupid
they were IN the well Alice said to the Dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark

course they said the Dormouse well
This answer so confused poor Alice that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it

were learning to draw the Dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy they drew all manner of things everything that begins with an M
with an M said Alice

not said the March Hare

Alice was silent

The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the Hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on that begins with an M such as and the moon and memory and muchness you know you say things are of a did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness
now you ask me said Alice very much confused think
you talk said the Hatter

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot

any rate never go THERE again said Alice as she picked her way through the wood
the stupidest I ever was at in all my life
Just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it
very curious she thought
curious today
I think I may as well go in at And in she went

Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table
manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden
Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and THEN she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright and the cool fountains


CHAPTER VIII
The
A large stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red
Alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say out now Five
go splashing paint over me like that
help it said Five in a sulky tone jogged my
On which Seven looked up and said right Five
Always lay the blame on others
better not talk said Five
heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded
for said the one who had spoken first

none of YOUR business Two said Seven

it IS his business said Five tell him it was for bringing the cook instead of
Seven flung down his brush and had just begun of all the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low

you tell me said Alice a little timidly you are painting those roses
Five and Seven said nothing but looked at Two
Two began in a low voice the fact is you see Miss this here ought to have been a RED and we put a white one in by mistake and if the Queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know
So you see Miss doing our best afore she comes to At this moment Five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out Queen
The Queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces
There was a sound of many footsteps and Alice looked round eager to see the Queen

First came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did
After these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts
Next came the guests mostly Kings and Queens and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her
Then followed the Knave of Hearts carrying the crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS

Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions besides what would be the use of a procession thought she people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they see it So she stood still where she was and waited

When the procession came opposite to Alice they all stopped and looked at her and the Queen said severely is this She said it to the Knave of Hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply

said the Queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to Alice she went on your name child
name is Alice so please your Majesty said Alice very politely but she added to herself only a pack of cards after all
I be afraid of them
who are THESE said the Queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children

should I know said Alice surprised at her own courage
no business of
The Queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed with her head
Off
said Alice very loudly and decidedly and the Queen was silent

The King laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said my dear she is only a child
The Queen turned angrily away from him and said to the Knave them over
The Knave did so very carefully with one foot

up said the Queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the King the Queen the royal children and everybody else

off that screamed the Queen
make me And then turning to the she went on HAVE you been doing here
it please your Majesty said Two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke were trying
see said the Queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses
with their heads and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to Alice for protection

be beheaded said Alice and she put them into a large that stood near
The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others

their heads off shouted the Queen

heads are gone if it please your Majesty the soldiers shouted in reply

right shouted the Queen
you play croquet
The soldiers were silent and looked at Alice as the question was evidently meant for her

shouted Alice

on then roared the Queen and Alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next

a very fine day said a timid voice at her side
She was walking by the White Rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face

said Alice the Duchess

Hush said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone
He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered under sentence of
for said Alice

you say a pity the Rabbit asked

I said Alice think at all a pity
I said for
boxed the ears the Rabbit began
Alice gave a little scream of laughter
hush the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone
Queen will hear you
You see she came rather late and the Queen said
to your places shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began
Alice thought she had never seen such a curious in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed

The players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting with his head or with her head about once in a minute

Alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen but she knew that it might happen any minute then thought she would become of me
dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that any one left alive
She was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself the Cheshire Cat now I shall have somebody to talk
are you getting on said the Cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with

Alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded
no use speaking to it she thought its ears have come or at least one of In another minute the whole head appeared and then Alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her
The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared

think they play at all fairly Alice began in rather a complaining tone they all quarrel so dreadfully one hear oneself speak and they seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to them and no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance the arch got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground and I should have croqueted the hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming
do you like the Queen said the Cat in a low voice

at all said Alice so extremely Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that hardly worth while finishing the
The Queen smiled and passed on

ARE you talking to said the King going up to Alice and looking at the head with great curiosity

a friend of mine a Cheshire Cat said Alice me to introduce
like the look of it at all said the King it may kiss my hand if it
rather not the Cat remarked

be impertinent said the King look at me like that He got behind Alice as he spoke

cat may look at a king said Alice
read that in some book but I remember
it must be removed said the King very decidedly and he called the Queen who was passing at the moment dear
I wish you would have this cat removed
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small
with his head she said without even looking round

fetch the executioner myself said the King eagerly and he hurried off

Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the voice in the distance screaming with passion
She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not
So she went in search of her hedgehog

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree

By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight it matter much thought Alice all the arches are gone from this side of the So she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend

When she got back to the Cheshire Cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the King and the Queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable

The moment Alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said

The argument was that you cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he going to begin at HIS time of life

The argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you to talk nonsense

The argument was that if something done about it in less than no time have everybody executed all round
It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious

Alice could think of nothing else to say but belongs to the Duchess better ask HER about
in prison the Queen said to the executioner her And the executioner went off like an arrow

The head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the Duchess it had entirely disappeared so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game


CHAPTER IX
The Mock Story
think how glad I am to see you again you dear old thing said the Duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into and they walked off together

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen

a Duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL
Soup does very well without Maybe always pepper that makes people she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes them bitter and and and such things that make children
I only wish people knew that then they be so stingy about it you know
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear
thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk
I tell you just now what the moral of that is but I shall remember it in a
it one Alice ventured to remark

tut child said the Duchess
got a moral if only you can find And she squeezed herself up closer to side as she spoke

Alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the Duchess was VERY ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin
However she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could

going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little

so said the Duchess the moral of that is love love that makes the world go round
said Alice whispered done by everybody minding their own business
well
It means much the same thing said the Duchess digging her sharp little chin into shoulder as she added the moral of THAT is care of the sense and the sounds will take care of
fond she is of finding morals in things Alice thought to herself

dare say wondering why I put my arm round your waist the Duchess said after a pause reason is that doubtful about the temper of your flamingo
Shall I try the experiment
might bite Alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried

true said the Duchess and mustard both bite
And the moral of that is of a feather flock
mustard a bird Alice remarked

as usual said the Duchess a clear way you have of putting things
a mineral I THINK said Alice

course it is said the Duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said a large near here
And the moral of that is more there is of mine the less there is of
I know exclaimed Alice who had not attended to this last remark a vegetable
It look like one but it
quite agree with you said the Duchess the moral of that is what you would seem to or if like it put more simply imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
think I should understand that better Alice said very politely I had it written down but I quite follow it as you say
nothing to what I could say if I chose the Duchess replied in a pleased tone

trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said Alice

talk about trouble said the Duchess
make you a present of everything said as
cheap sort of present thought Alice
glad they give birthday presents like that But she did not venture to say it out loud

again the Duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin

a right to think said Alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried

about as much right said the Duchess pigs have to fly and the m
But here to great surprise the voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble
Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm

fine day your Majesty the Duchess began in a low weak voice

I give you fair warning shouted the Queen stamping on the ground as she spoke you or your head must be off and that in about half no time
Take your choice
The Duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment

go on with the game the Queen said to Alice and Alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the

The other guests had taken advantage of the absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the Queen merely remarking that a delay would cost them their lives

All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting with his head or with her head Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the King the Queen and Alice were in custody and under sentence of execution

Then the Queen left off quite out of breath and said to Alice you seen the Mock Turtle yet
said Alice
even know what a Mock Turtle
the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from said the Queen

never saw one or heard of one said Alice

on then said the Queen he shall tell you his history
As they walked off together Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally are all a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered

They very soon came upon a Gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun
IF you know what a Gryphon is look at the picture
lazy thing said the Queen take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle and to hear his history
I must go back and see after some executions I have and she walked off leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon
Alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen so she waited

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled
fun said the Gryphon half to itself half to Alice

IS the fun said Alice

SHE said the Gryphon
all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know
Come on
says on here thought Alice as she went slowly after it never was so ordered about in all my life never
They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break
She pitied him deeply
is his sorrow she asked the Gryphon and the Gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before all his fancy that he got no sorrow you know
Come on
So they went up to the Mock Turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing

here young lady said the Gryphon wants for to know your history she
tell it her said the Mock Turtle in a deep hollow tone down both of you and speak a word till
So they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes
Alice thought to herself see how he can EVEN finish if he But she waited patiently

said the Mock Turtle at last with a deep sigh was a real
These words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of from the Gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle
Alice was very nearly getting up and saying you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there MUST be more to come so she sat still and said nothing

we were little the Mock Turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then went to school in the sea
The master was an old Turtle we used to call him Tortoise
did you call him Tortoise if he one Alice asked

called him Tortoise because he taught us said the Mock Turtle angrily you are very dull
ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the Gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice who felt ready to sink into the earth
At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle on old fellow
be all day about it and he went on in these words
we went to school in the sea though you believe it
never said I interrupted Alice

did said the Mock Turtle

your tongue added the Gryphon before Alice could speak again
The Mock Turtle went on

had the best of educations in fact we went to school every day
been to a too said Alice be so proud as all
extras asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously

said Alice learned French and
washing said the Mock Turtle

not said Alice indignantly


then yours a really good school said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief
at OURS they had at the end of the bill music AND WASHING
have wanted it much said Alice at the bottom of the
afford to learn said the Mock Turtle with a sigh
only took the regular
was that inquired Alice

and Writhing of course to begin with the Mock Turtle replied then the different branches of Arithmetic Ambition Distraction Uglification and
never heard of Alice ventured to say
is it
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise

Never heard of uglifying it exclaimed
know what to beautify is I suppose
said Alice doubtfully means to make anything
then the Gryphon went on you know what to uglify is you ARE a
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the Mock Turtle and said else had you to learn
there was Mystery the Mock Turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers Mystery ancient and modern with Seaography then Drawling the was an old that used to come once a week HE taught us Drawling Stretching and Fainting in
was THAT like said Alice

I show it you myself the Mock Turtle said too stiff
And the Gryphon never learnt
time said the Gryphon went to the Classics master though
He was an old crab HE
never went to him the Mock Turtle said with a sigh taught Laughing and Grief they used to
he did so he did said the Gryphon sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paws

how many hours a day did you do lessons said Alice in a hurry to change the subject

hours the first day said the Mock Turtle the next and so
a curious plan exclaimed Alice

the reason called lessons the Gryphon remarked they lessen from day to
This was quite a new idea to Alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark
the eleventh day must have been a holiday
course it was said the Mock Turtle

how did you manage on the twelfth Alice went on eagerly

enough about lessons the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone her something about the games

CHAPTER X
The Lobster Quadrille
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes
He looked at Alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice
as if he had a bone in his throat said the Gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back
At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on again
may not have lived much under the sea said Alice perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster Alice began to say once tasted but checked herself hastily and said so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is
indeed said Alice
sort of a dance is it
said the Gryphon first form into a line along the
lines cried the Mock Turtle
turtles salmon and so on then when cleared all the out of the way
generally takes some time interrupted the Gryphon

you advance twice
with a lobster as a partner cried the Gryphon

course the Mock Turtle said twice set to partners
change lobsters and retire in same order continued the Gryphon

you know the Mock Turtle went on throw the
lobsters shouted the Gryphon with a bound into the air

as far out to sea as you can
after them screamed the Gryphon

a somersault in the sea cried the Mock Turtle capering wildly about

lobsters again yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice

to land again and all the first figure said the Mock Turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at Alice

must be a very pretty dance said Alice timidly

you like to see a little of it said the Mock Turtle

much indeed said Alice

try the first figure said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon
can do without lobsters you know
Which shall sing
YOU sing said the Gryphon
forgotten the
So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the Mock Turtle sang this very slowly and sadly
you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail
a porpoise close behind us and treading on my tail

See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance
They are waiting on the shingle will you come and join the dance

Will you you will you you will you join the dance
Will you you will you you you join the dance

can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea But the snail replied far too far and gave a look askance Said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance

Would not could not would not could not would not join the dance
Would not could not would not could not could not join the dance

matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied
is another shore you know upon the other side
The further off from England the nearer is to France Then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance

Will you you will you you will you join the dance
Will you you will you you you join the dance
you a very interesting dance to watch said Alice feeling very glad that it was over at last I do so like that curious song about the whiting
as to the whiting said the Mock Turtle seen them of course
said Alice often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily

know where Dinn may be said the Mock Turtle if seen them so often of course you know what
believe so Alice replied thoughtfully
have their tails in their mouths and all over
wrong about the crumbs said the Mock Turtle would all wash off in the sea
But they HAVE their tails in their mouths and the reason is here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his her about the reason and all that he said to the Gryphon

reason is said the Gryphon they WOULD go with the lobsters to the dance
So they got thrown out to sea
So they had to fall a long way
So they got their tails fast in their mouths
So they get them out again

you said Alice very interesting
I never knew so much about a whiting
can tell you more than that if you like said the Gryphon
you know why called a whiting
never thought about it said Alice

DOES THE BOOTS AND the Gryphon replied very solemnly

Alice was thoroughly puzzled
the boots and shoes she repeated in a wondering tone

what are YOUR shoes done with said the Gryphon
mean what makes them so shiny
Alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer
done with blacking I
and shoes under the sea the Gryphon went on in a deep voice done with a whiting
Now you
what are they made of Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity

and eels of course the Gryphon replied rather impatiently shrimp could have told you
been the whiting said Alice whose thoughts were still running on the song have said to the porpoise back please we want YOU with us
were obliged to have him with them the Mock Turtle said wise fish would go anywhere without a
it really said Alice in a tone of great surprise

course not said the Mock Turtle if a fish came to ME and told me he was going a journey I should say what porpoise
you mean said Alice

mean what I say the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone
And the Gryphon added hear some of YOUR
could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning said Alice a little timidly no use going back to yesterday because I was a different person
all that said the Mock Turtle

no
The adventures first said the Gryphon in an impatient tone take such a dreadful
So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit
She was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide but she gained courage as she went on
Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating ARE OLD FATHER WILLIAM to the Caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath and said very
all about as curious as it can be said the Gryphon

all came different the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully
should like to hear her try and repeat something now
Tell her to He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice

up and repeat THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD said the Gryphon

the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought Alice might as well be at school at However she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed
the voice of the Lobster I heard him declare have baked me too brown I must sugar my As a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his
later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark But when the tide rises and sharks are around His voice has a timid and tremulous sound

different from what I used to say when I was a child said the Gryphon

I never heard it before said the Mock Turtle it sounds uncommon
Alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again

should like to have it explained said the Mock Turtle

explain it said the Gryphon hastily
on with the next
about his toes the Mock Turtle persisted
COULD he turn them out with his nose you know
the first position in Alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject

on with the next verse the Gryphon repeated impatiently begins passed by his
Alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice
passed by his garden and marked with one eye How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie
later editions continued as follows The Panther took and gravy and meat While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat
When the pie was all finished the Owl as a boon Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl And concluded the banquet
IS the use of repeating all that stuff the Mock Turtle interrupted you explain it as you go on
by far the most confusing thing I ever heard
I think better leave off said the Gryphon and Alice was only too glad to do so

we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille the Gryphon went on
would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song
a song please if the Mock Turtle would be so kind Alice replied so eagerly that the Gryphon said in a rather offended tone
No accounting for tastes
Sing her Soup will you old fellow
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this
Soup so rich and green Waiting in a hot tureen
Who for such dainties would not stoop
Soup of the evening beautiful Soup
Soup of the evening beautiful Soup
Beau ootiful Soo oop
Beau ootiful Soo oop
Soo oop of the e e evening Beautiful beautiful Soup

Soup
Who cares for fish Game or any other dish
Who would not give all else for two Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup
Beau ootiful Soo oop
Beau ootiful Soo oop
Soo oop of the e e evening Beautiful beauti FUL SOUP
again cried the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of beginning was heard in the distance

on cried the Gryphon and taking Alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song

trial is it Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon only answered on and ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words
oop of the e e evening Beautiful beautiful Soup

CHAPTER XI
Who Stole the Tarts

The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the Knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the King was the White Rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other
In the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them wish get the trial done she thought hand round the refreshments But there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time

Alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there
the judge she said to herself of his great
The judge by the way was the King and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming

the thought Alice those twelve creatures she was obliged to say you see because some of them were animals and some were birds suppose they are the She said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all
However would have done just as well

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates
are they doing Alice whispered to the Gryphon
have anything to put down yet before the
putting down their names the Gryphon whispered in reply fear they should forget them before the end of the
things Alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the White Rabbit cried out in the court and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking

Alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down things on their slates and she could even make out that one of them know how to spell and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him
nice muddle their be in before the over thought Alice

One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked
This of course Alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away
She did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was Bill the Lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate

read the accusation said the King

On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows
Queen of Hearts she made some tarts All on a summer day The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts And took them quite away
your verdict the King said to the jury

yet not yet the Rabbit hastily interrupted
a great deal to come before that
the first witness said the King and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out witness
The first witness was the Hatter
He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of in the other
beg pardon your Majesty he began bringing these in but I quite finished my tea when I was sent
ought to have finished said the King
did you begin
The Hatter looked at the March Hare who had followed him into the court with the Dormouse
of March I think it was he said

said the March Hare

added the Dormouse

that down the King said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence

off your hat the King said to the Hatter

mine said the Hatter

the King exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact

keep them to sell the Hatter added as an explanation none of my own
a
Here the Queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the Hatter who turned pale and fidgeted

your evidence said the King be nervous or have you executed on the
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the Queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her

wish you squeeze said the Dormouse who was sitting next to her
can hardly
help it said Alice very meekly
no right to grow here said the Dormouse

talk nonsense said Alice more boldly know growing
but I grow at a reasonable pace said the Dormouse in that ridiculous And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court

All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter and just as the Dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court me the list of the singers in the last concert on which the wretched Hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off

your evidence the King repeated angrily have you executed whether nervous or
a poor man your Majesty the Hatter began in a trembling voice and I begun my tea not above a week or so and what with the getting so thin and the twinkling of the tea
twinkling of the what said the King

began with the tea the Hatter replied

course twinkling begins with a T said the King sharply
you take me for a dunce
Go on
a poor man the Hatter went on most things twinkled after that only the March Hare said
the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry

did said the Hatter

deny it said the March Hare

denies it said the King out that
at any rate the Dormouse said the Hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the Dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep

that continued the Hatter cut some more
what did the Dormouse say one of the jury asked

I remember said the Hatter

MUST remember remarked the King have you
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and and went down on one knee
a poor man your Majesty he began

a very poor speaker said the King

Here one of the cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court
As that is rather a hard word I will just explain to you how it was done
They had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the head first and then sat upon it

glad seen that done thought Alice
so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and I never understood what it meant till
all you know about it you may stand down continued the King

go no lower said the Hatter on the floor as it
you may SIT down the King replied

Here the other cheered and was suppressed

that finished the thought Alice
we shall get on
rather finish my tea said the Hatter with an anxious look at the Queen who was reading the list of singers

may go said the King and the Hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on

and just take his head off outside the Queen added to one of the officers but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door

the next witness said the King

The next witness was the cook
She carried the in her hand and Alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once

your evidence said the King

said the cook

The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit who said in a low voice Majesty must THIS
if I must I must the King said with a melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice are tarts made of
mostly said the cook

said a sleepy voice behind her

that Dormouse the Queen shrieked out
that Dormouse
Turn that Dormouse out of court
Suppress him
Pinch him
Off with his whiskers
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the Dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared

mind said the King with an air of great relief
the next And he added in an undertone to the Queen my dear YOU must the next witness
It quite makes my forehead ache
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like for they got much evidence YET she said to herself
Imagine her surprise when the White Rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name

CHAPTER XII
Evidence
cried Alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before

I BEG your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the or they would die

trial can not proceed said the King in a very grave voice all the jurymen are back in their proper places ALL he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at Alice as he said do

Alice looked at the and saw that in her haste she had put the Lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move
She soon got it out again and put it right that it signifies much she said to herself should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the
As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the Lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court

do you know about this business the King said to Alice

said Alice

WHATEVER persisted the King

whatever said Alice

very important the King said turning to the jury
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the White Rabbit interrupted your Majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke

of course I meant the King hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone
unimportant unimportant important as if he were trying which word sounded best

Some of the jury wrote it down and some Alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates it matter a bit she thought to herself

At this moment the King who had been for some time busily writing in his cackled out and read out from his book
ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE
Everybody looked at Alice

not a mile high said Alice

are said the King

two miles high added the Queen

I go at any rate said Alice not a regular rule you invented it just
the oldest rule in the book said the King

it ought to be Number One said Alice

The King turned pale and shut his hastily
your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice

more evidence to come yet please your Majesty said the White Rabbit jumping up in a great hurry paper has just been picked
in it said the Queen

opened it yet said the White Rabbit it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to to
must have been that said the King it was written to nobody which usual you
is it directed to said one of the jurymen

directed at all said the White Rabbit fact nothing written on the He unfolded the paper as he spoke and added a letter after all a set of
they in the handwriting asked another of the jurymen

not said the White Rabbit the queerest thing about The jury all looked puzzled

must have imitated somebody hand said the King
The jury all brightened up again

your Majesty said the Knave write it and they prove I did no name signed at the
you sign it said the King only makes the matter worse
You MUST have meant some mischief or else have signed your name like an honest
There was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day

PROVES his guilt said the Queen

proves nothing of the sort said Alice
you even know what about
them said the King

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles
shall I begin please your Majesty he asked

at the beginning the King said gravely go on till you come to the end then
These were the verses the White Rabbit read
told me you had been to her And mentioned me to him She gave me a good character But said I could not swim

He sent them word I had not gone We know it to be true If she should push the matter on What would become of you

I gave her one they gave him two You gave us three or more They all returned from him to you Though they were mine before

If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair He trusts to you to set them free Exactly as we were

My notion was that you had been Before she had this fit An obstacle that came between Him and ourselves and it

let him know she liked them best For this must ever be A secret kept from all the rest Between yourself and
the most important piece of evidence heard yet said the King rubbing his hands now let the jury
any one of them can explain it said Alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she a bit afraid of interrupting him give him sixpence
believe an atom of meaning in
The jury all wrote down on their slates believe an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper

no meaning in it said the King saves a world of trouble you know as we try to find any
And yet I know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye seem to see some meaning in them after all
SAID I COULD NOT SWIM you swim can you he added turning to the Knave

The Knave shook his head sadly
I look like it he said
Which he certainly did NOT being made entirely of cardboard

right so far said the King and he went on muttering over the verses to himself KNOW IT TO BE TRUE the jury of course GAVE HER ONE THEY GAVE HIM TWO why that must be what he did with the tarts you know
it goes on ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU said Alice

there they are said the King triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table
can be clearer than THAT
Then again SHE HAD THIS FIT you never had fits my dear I think he said to the Queen

said the Queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke
The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted

the words FIT you said the King looking round the court with a smile
There was a dead silence

a pun the King added in an offended tone and everybody laughed the jury consider their verdict the King said for about the twentieth time that day

no said the Queen
first verdict
and nonsense said Alice loudly
idea of having the sentence first
your tongue said the Queen turning purple

said Alice

with her head the Queen shouted at the top of her voice
Nobody moved

cares for you said Alice she had grown to her full size by this time
nothing but a pack of cards
At this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face

up Alice dear said her sister what a long sleep had
had such a curious dream said Alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said WAS a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea getting So Alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been

But her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream
First she dreamed of little Alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes and still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little dream

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their meal and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the was sneezing on the knee while plates and dishes crashed around it once more the shriek of the Gryphon the squeaking of the and the choking of the suppressed filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle

So she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in Wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling and the shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the Gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock heavy sobs

Lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own and the happy summer days

THE END
