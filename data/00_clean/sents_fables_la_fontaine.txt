FABLES OF LA FONTAINE
THE FLY AND THE GAME

A knight of and shot Once fill his bag as I would not Unless the feelings of my breast By poverty were sorely press With birds and squirrels for the spits Of certain gormandizing cits
With merry heart the fellow went Direct to Centpercent Who loved as well was understood Whatever game was nice and good
This gentleman with knowing air Survey the dainty lot with care Pronounced it racy rich and rare And call his wife to know her wishes About its purchase for their dishes
The lady thought the creatures prime And for their dinner just in time So sweet they were and delicate For dinner she could hardly wait
But now there came could luck be worse Just as the buyer drew his purse A bulky fly with solemn buzz And smelt as an inspector does This bird and that and said the meat But here his words I wo repeat Was anything but fit to eat

cried the lady a fly I never knew to tell a lie His coat you see is He knows a thing or two I ween My dear I beg you do not buy Such game as this may suit the dogs
So on our peddling sportsman jogs His soul possess of this surmise About some men as well as flies A filthy taint they soonest find Who are to relish filth inclined


THE DOG AND CAT

A dog and cat messmates for life Were often falling into strife Which came to scratching growls and snaps And spitting in the face perhaps
A neighbour dog once chanced to call Just at the outset of their brawl And thinking Tray was cross and cruel To snarl so sharp at Growl rather roughly in his ear
who are you to interfere
Exclaim the cat while in his face she flew And as was wise he suddenly withdrew

It seems in spite of all his snarling And hers that Tray was still her darling


THE GOLDEN PITCHER

A father once whose sons were two For each a gift had much ado
At last upon this course he fell sons said he our well Two treasures lodge as I am told The one a sunken piece of gold A bowl it may be or a pitcher The other is a thing far richer
These treasures if you can but find Each may be suited to his mind For both are precious in their kind
To gain the one you need a hook The other will but cost a look
But O of this I pray beware You who may choose the tempting share Too eager fishing for the pitcher May ruin that which is far richer

Out ran the boys their gifts to draw But eagerness was check with awe How could there be a richer prize Than solid gold beneath the skies
Or if there could how could it dwell Within their own old mossy well
Were questions which excited wonder And kept their headlong under
The golden cup each fear to choose Lest he the better gift should lose And so resolved our prudent pair The gifts in common they would share
The well was open to the sky
As its curb they keenly pry It seems a tunnel piercing through From sky to sky from blue to blue And at its nether mouth each sees A brace of their antipodes With earnest faces peering up As if themselves might seek the cup

said the elder with a laugh need not share it by the half
The mystery is clear to me That richer gift to all is free
Be only as that water true And then the whole belongs to you

That truth itself was worth so much It can not be supposed that such
A pair of lads were satisfied And yet they were before they died
But whether they fish up the gold I sure I never have been told
Thus much they learn I take for granted And that was what their father wanted If truth for wealth we sacrifice We throw away the richer prize


PARTY STRIFE

Among the beasts a feud arose
The lion as the story goes Once on a time laid down His sceptre and his crown And in his stead the beasts elected As often as it suited them A sort of king Some animal they much respected
At first they all concurr
The horse the stag the unicorn Were chosen each in turn And then the noble bird That looks undazzled at the sun
But party strife began to run Through burrow den and herd
Some beasts proposed the patient ox And others named the cunning fox
The quarrel came to bites and knocks Nor was it duly settled Till many a beast Had bought an aching head Or possibly had bled
The fox as one might well suppose At last above his rival rose But truth to say his reign was bootless Of honour being rather fruitless
All prudent beasts began to see The throne a certain charm had lost And won by strife as it must be Was hardly worth the pains it cost
So when his majesty retired Few worthy beasts his seat desired
Especially now stood aloof The wise of head the swift of hoof The beasts whose breasts were
It consequently came to pass Not first but as we say in fine For king the creatures chose the ass He for prime minister the swine

is thus that party spirit Is prone to banish merit


THE CAT AND THE THRUSH

A thrush that sang one rustic ode Once made a garden his abode And gave the owner such delight He grew a special favourite
Indeed his landlord did his best To make him safe from every foe The ground about his lowly nest Was undisturb by spade or hoe
And yet his song was still the same It even grew somewhat more tame
At length Grimalkin spied the pet Resolved that he should suffer yet And laid his plan of devastation So as to save his reputation For in the house from looks demure He pass for honest kind and pure
Professing search of mice and moles He through the garden daily strolls And never seeks our thrush to catch But when his consort comes to hatch Just eats the young ones in a batch
The sadness of the pair bereaved Their generous guardian sorely grieved
But yet it could not be believed His faithful cat was in the wrong Though so the thrush said in his song
The cat was therefore favour still To walk the garden at his will And hence the birds to shun the pest Upon a built their nest
Though there it cost them vastly more was vastly better than before
And Gaffer Thrush directly found His throat when raised above the ground Gave forth a softer sweeter sound
New tunes moreover he had caught By perils and afflictions taught And found new things to sing about New scenes had brought new talents out
So while improved beyond a doubt His own old song more clearly rang Far better than themselves he sang The chants and trills of other birds He even mock Grimalkin words With such delightful humour that He gain the Christian name of Cat

Let Genius tell in verse and prose
How much to praise and friends it owes
Good sense may be as I suppose As much indebted to its foes


In Wright wrote the Preface to the first collected edition of the works of the poet Whittier and soon after he seems to have become completely absorbed in politics and in the mighty struggle which constituted the greater part of the politics of the United States in those and many succeeding years
He became a journalist in the cause and in he wrote a trenchant answer to Carlyle then just published Latter Day Pamphlets
Later on slavery having been at length abolished he appeared as a writer in yet another field publishing several works one as lately as on

To The First Edition Of This Translation

Boston

Four years ago I dropped into Charles de Behr repository of foreign books in Broadway New York and there for the first time saw La Fontaine Fables
It was a cheap copy adorned with some two hundred woodcuts which by their worn appearance betokened an extensive manufacture
I became a purchaser and gave the book to my little boy then just beginning to feel the intellectual magnetism of pictures
In the course of the next year he frequently tasked my imperfect knowledge of French for the story which belonged to some favourite vignette
This led me to inquire whether any English version existed and not finding any I resolved though quite unused to literary exercises of the sort to cheat sleep of an hour every morning till there should be one
The result is before you
If in this I have wronged La Fontaine I hope the of poets as well as yourselves will forgive me and lay the blame on the better qualified who have so long neglected the task
Cowper should have done it
The author of John Gilpin and the Retired Cat would have put La Fontaine into every which resounds with the tongue To you who have so generously enabled me to publish this work with so great advantages and without selling the copyright for the of a song I return my heartfelt thanks
A spectacled threadbare stranger knocked at your doors with a prospectus unbacked by the trade soliciting your subscription to a costly edition of a mere translation
It is a most inglorious unsatisfactory species of literature
The slightest preponderance of that worldly wisdom which never buys a would have sent him and his translation packing
But a kind faith in your species got the better in your case
You not only gave the stranger your good wishes but your good names
A list of those names it would delight me to insert and I should certainly do it if I felt authorized
As it is I hope to be pardoned for mentioning some of the individuals who have not only given their names but expressed an interest in my enterprise which has assisted me in its accomplishment

Luther Bradish and Molinard have special claims to my gratitude
The work as it is not as it ought to be I commit to your kindness
I do not claim to have succeeded in translating the inimitable La Fontaine perhaps I have not even a right to say in his own language

A PREFACE
on
Fable The Fabulists And La Fontaine

By The Translator

Human nature when fresh from the hand of God was full of poetry
Its sociality could not be pent within the bounds of the actual
To the lower inhabitants of air earth and water and even to those elements themselves in all their parts and forms it gave speech and reason
The skies it peopled with beings on the noblest model of which it could have any conception to wit its own
The intercourse of these beings thus created and endowed from the deity kindled into immortality by the imagination to the clod personified for the moment gratified one of its strongest propensities for man may well enough be defined as the historical animal
The faculty which in after ages was to chronicle the realities developed by time had at first no employment but to place on record the productions of the imagination
Hence fable blossomed and ripened in the remotest antiquity
We see it mingling itself with the primeval history of all nations
It is not improbable that many of the narratives which have been preserved for us by the bark or parchment of the first rude histories as serious matters of fact were originally apologues or parables invented to give power and wings to moral lessons and afterwards modified in their passage from mouth to mouth by the magic of credulity
The most ancient poets graced their productions with apologues
Hesiod fable of the Hawk and the Nightingale is an instance
The fable or parable was anciently as it is even now a favourite weapon of the most successful orators
When Jotham would show the Shechemites the folly of their ingratitude he uttered the fable of the the Olive the Vine and the Bramble
When the prophet Nathan would oblige David to pass a sentence of condemnation upon himself in the matter of Uriah he brought before him the apologue of the rich man who having many sheep took away that of the poor man who had but one
When Joash the king of Israel would rebuke the vanity of Amaziah the king of Judah he referred him to the fable of the Thistle and the Cedar
Our blessed Saviour the best of all teachers was remarkable for his constant use of parables which are but fables we speak it with reverence adapted to the gravity of the subjects on which he discoursed
And in profane history we read that Stesichorus put the Himerians on their guard against the tyranny of Phalaris by the fable of the Horse and the Stag
Cyrus for the instruction of kings told the story of the fisher obliged to use his nets to take the fish that turned a deaf ear to the sound of his flute
Menenius Agrippa wishing to bring back the mutinous Roman people from Mount Sacer ended his harangue with the fable of the Belly and the Members
A Ligurian in order to dissuade King Comanus from yielding to the Phocians a portion of his territory as the site of Marseilles introduced into his discourse the story of the bitch that borrowed a kennel in which to bring forth her young but when they were sufficiently grown refused to give it up

In all these instances we see that fable was a mere auxiliary of discourse an implement of the orator
Such probably was the origin of the apologues which now form the bulk of the most popular collections
Aesop who lived about six hundred years before Christ so far as we can reach the reality of his life was an orator who wielded the apologue with remarkable skill
From a servile condition he rose by the force of his genius to be the counsellor of kings and states
His wisdom was in demand far and wide and on the most important occasions
The pithy apologues which fell from his lips which like the rules of arithmetic solved the difficult problems of human conduct constantly presented to him were remembered when the speeches that contained them were forgotten
He seems to have written nothing himself but it was not long before the gems which he scattered began to be gathered up in collections as a distinct species of literature
The great and good Socrates employed himself while in prison in turning the fables of Aesop into verse
Though but a few fragments of his composition have come down to us he may perhaps be regarded as the father of fable considered as a distinct art
Induced by his example many Greek poets and philosophers tried their hands in it
Archilocus Alcaeus Aristotle Plato Diodorus Plutarch and Lucian have left us specimens
Collections of fables bearing the name of Aesop became current in the Greek language
It was not however till the year that the large collection which now bears his name was put forth in Greek prose by Planudes a monk of Constantinople
This man turned the life of Aesop itself into a fable and La Fontaine did it the honour to translate it as a preface to his own collection
Though burdened with insufferable puerilities it is not without the moral that a rude and deformed exterior may conceal both wit and worth

The collection of fables in Greek verse by Babrias was exceedingly popular among the Romans
It was the favourite book of the Emperor Julian
Only six of these fables and a few fragments remain but they are sufficient to show that their author possessed all the graces of style which befit the apologue
Some critics place him in the Augustan age others make him contemporary with Moschus
His work was versified in Latin at the instance of Seneca and Quinctilian refers to it as a for boys
Thus at all times these playful fictions have been considered fit lessons for children as well as for men who are often but children
So popular were the fables of Babrias and their Latin translation during the Roman empire that the work of Phaedrus was hardly noticed
The latter was a freedman of Augustus and wrote in the reign of Tiberius
His verse stands almost unrivalled for its exquisite elegance and compactness and posterity has abundantly avenged him for the neglect of contemporaries
La Fontaine is perhaps more indebted to Phaedrus than to any other of his predecessors and especially in the first six books his style has much of the same curious condensation
When the seat of the empire was transferred to Byzantium the Greek language took precedence of the Latin and the rhetorician Aphthonius wrote forty fables in Greek prose which became popular
Besides these collections among the Romans we find apologues scattered through the writings of their best poets and historians and embalmed in those specimens of their oratory which have come down to us

The apologues of the Greeks and Romans were brief pithy and epigrammatic and their collections were without any principle of connection
But at the same time though probably unknown to them the same species of literature was flourishing elsewhere under a somewhat different form
It is made a question whether Aesop through the Assyrians with whom the Phrygians had commercial relations did not either borrow his art from the Orientals or lend it to them
This disputed subject must be left to those who have a taste for such inquiries
Certain it is however that fable flourished very anciently with the people whose faith embraces the doctrine of metempsychosis
Among the Hindoos there are two very ancient collections of fables which differ from those which we have already mentioned in having a principle of connection throughout
They are in fact extended romances or dramas in which all sorts of creatures are introduced as actors and in which there is a development of sentiment and passion as well as of moral truth the whole being wrought into a system of morals particularly adapted to the use of those called to govern
One of these works is called the which signifies Five Books or Pentateuch
It is written in prose
The other is called the or Friendly Instruction and is written in verse
Both are in the ancient Sanscrit language and bear the name of a Brahmin Vishnoo Sarmah as the author
Sir William Jones who is inclined to make this author the true Aesop of the world and to doubt the existence of the Phrygian gives him the preference to all other fabulists both in regard to matter and manner
He has left a prose translation of the which though it may not fully sustain his enthusiastic preference shows it not to be entirely groundless
We give a sample of it and select a fable which La Fontaine has served up as the of his eighth book
It should be understood that the fable with the moral reflections which accompany it is taken from the speech of one animal to another

Sir William Jones has the name
He says further that the word comes from signifying fortune prosperity utility and signifying advice the entire word meaning salutary or amicable instruction Ed

Frugality should ever be practised but not excessive parsimony for see how a miser was killed by a bow drawn by himself

How was that
said Hiranyaca

In the country of Calyanacataca said Menthara lived a mighty hunter named Bhairaza or Terrible
One day he went in search of game into a forest on the mountains Vindhya when having slain a fawn and taken it up he perceived a boar of tremendous size he therefore threw the fawn on the ground and wounded the boar with an arrow the beast horribly roaring rushed upon him and wounded him desperately so that he fell like a tree stricken with an axe


In the meanwhile a jackal named Lougery was roving in search of food and having perceived the fawn the hunter and the boar all three dead he said to himself a noble provision is here made for me

As the pains of men assail them unexpectedly so their pleasures come in the same manner a divine power strongly operates in both

it so the flesh of these three animals will sustain me a whole month or longer

man suffices for one month a fawn and a boar for two a snake for a whole day and then I will devour the bowstring
When the first impulse of his hunger was allayed he said flesh is not yet tender let me taste the twisted string with which the horns of this bow are joined
So saying he began to gnaw it but in the instant when he had cut the string the severed bow leaped forcibly up and wounded him in the breast so that he departed in the agonies of death
This I meant when I cited the verse Frugality should ever be practised

What thou givest to distinguished men and what thou eatest every day that in my opinion is thine own wealth whose is the remainder which thou hoardest

Edition Ed

It was one of these books which Chosroës the king of Persia caused to be translated from the Sanscrit into the ancient language of his country in the sixth century of the Christian era sending an embassy into Hindostan expressly for that purpose
Of the Persian book a translation was made in the time of the Calif Mansour in the eighth century into Arabic
This Arabic translation it is which became famous under the title of The Book of Calila and Dimna or the Fables of Bidpaï

An English translation from the Arabic appeared in done by the Rev
Wyndham Knatchbull
Sir William Jones says that the word signifies beloved or favourite physician
And he adds that the word which has taken the place of in some editions of these fables is the result simply of a blunder in copying the word from the original
La Fontaine himself uses the word twice in his Fables in Fables XII
and Book Ed

Calila and Dimna are the names of two jackals that figure in the history and Bidpaï is one of the principal human interlocutors who came to be mistaken for the author
This remarkable book was turned into verse by several of the Arabic poets was translated into Greek Hebrew Latin modern Persian and in the course of a few centuries either directly or indirectly into most of the languages of modern Europe

of the unadorned and disconnected fables of Aesop were also translated into Arabic at a period somewhat more recent than the Hegira and passed by the name of the Fables of Lokman
Their want of poetical ornament prevented them from acquiring much popularity with the Arabians but they became well known in Europe as furnishing a convenient in the study of Arabic

The the fountain of poetic fables with its innumerable translations and modifications seems to have had the greatest charms for the Orientals
As it passed down the stream of time version after version the ornament and machinery outgrew the moral instruction till it gave birth at last to such works of mere amusement as the Thousand and One Nights

Fable slept with other things in the dark ages of Europe
Abridgments took the place of the large collections and probably occasioned the entire loss of some of them
As literature revived fable was resuscitated
The crusades had brought European mind in contact with the Indian works which we have already described in their Arabic dress
Translations and imitations in the European tongues were speedily multiplied
The Romance of the Fox the work of Perrot de Saint Cloud one of the most successful of these imitations dates back to the thirteenth century
It found its way into most of the northern languages and became a household book
It undoubtedly had great influence over the taste of succeeding ages shedding upon the severe and satirical wit of the Greek and Roman literature the rich mellow light of Asiatic poetry
The poets of that age were not confined however to fables from the Hindoo source
Marie de France also in the thirteenth century versified one hundred of the fables of Aesop translating from an English collection which does not now appear to be extant
Her work is entitled the or Little Aesop
Other versions with the same title were subsequently written
It was in that Planudes already referred to wrote in Greek prose a collection of fables prefacing it with a life of Aesop which for a long time passed for the veritable work of that ancient
In the next century Abstemius wrote two hundred fables in Latin prose partly of modern but chiefly of ancient invention
At this time the vulgar languages had undergone so great changes that works in them of two or three centuries old could not be understood and consequently the Latin became the favourite language of authors
Many collections of fables were written in it both in prose and verse
By the art of printing these works were greatly multiplied and again the poets undertook the task of translating them into the language of the people
The French led the way in this species of literature their language seeming to present some great advantages for it
One hundred years before La Fontaine Corrozet Guillaume Gueroult and Philibert Hegemon had written beautiful fables in verse which it is supposed La Fontaine must have read and profited by although they had become nearly obsolete in his time
It is a remarkable fact that these poetical fables should so soon have been forgotten
It was soon after their appearance that the languages of Europe attained their full development and at this epoch prose seems to have been universally preferred to poetry
So strong was this preference that Ogilby the Scotch fabulist who had written a collection of fables in English verse reduced them to prose on the occasion of publishing a more splendid edition in
It seems to have been the settled opinion of the critics of that age as it has indeed been stoutly maintained since that the ornaments of poetry only impair the force of the fable that the Muses by becoming the handmaids of old Aesop part with their own dignity without conferring any on him
La Fontaine has made such an opinion almost heretical
In his manner there is a perfect originality and an immortality every way equal to that of the matter which he gathered up from all parts of the great storehouse of human experience
His fables are like pure gold enveloped in solid
In English a few of the fables of Gay of Moore and of Cowper may be compared with them in some respects but we have nothing resembling them as a whole
Gay who has done more than any other though he has displayed great power of invention and has given his verse a flow worthy of his master Pope has yet fallen far behind La Fontaine in the general management of his materials
His fables are all beautiful poems but few of them are beautiful fables
His animal speakers do not sufficiently preserve their animal characters
It is quite otherwise with La Fontaine
His beasts are made most nicely to observe all the proprieties not only of the scene in which they are called to speak but of the great drama into which they are from time to time introduced
His work constitutes an harmonious whole
To those who read it in the original it is one of the few which never cloy the appetite
As in the poetry of Burns you are apt to think the last verse you read of him the best

But the main object of this Preface was to give a few traces of the life and literary career of our poet
A remarkable poet can not but have been a remarkable man
Suppose we take a man with native benevolence amounting almost to folly but little cunning caution or veneration good perceptive but better reflective faculties and a dominant love of the beautiful and toss him into the focus of civilization in the age of Louis XIV
It is an interesting problem to find out what will become of him
Such is the problem worked out in the life of JEAN DE LA FONTAINE born on the eighth of July at
His father a man of some substance and station committed two blunders in disposing of his son
First he encouraged him to seek an education for ecclesiastical life which was evidently unsuited to his disposition
Second he brought about his marriage with a woman who was unfitted to secure his affections or to manage his domestic affairs
In one other point he was not so much mistaken he laboured unremittingly to make his son a poet
Jean was a backward boy and showed not the least spark of poetical genius till his year
His poetical genius did not ripen till long after that time
But his father lived to see him all and more than all that he had ever hoped

The Translator in his sixth edition replaced the next paragraph by the following remarks The case is apparently and only apparently an exception to the old rule nascitur orator the poet is born the orator is made
The truth is without exception that every poet is born such and many are born such of whose poetry the world knows nothing
Every known poet is also somewhat an orator and as to this part of his character he is made
And many are known as poets who are altogether made they are mere or orator poets and are quite intolerable unless exceedingly well made which is unfortunately seldom the case
It would be wise in them to busy themselves as mere translators
Every one who is born with propensities to love and wonder too strong and deep to be worn off by repetition or continuance in other words who is born to be always young is born a poet
The other requisites he has of course
Upon him the making will never be lost
The richest gems do most honour to their polishing
But they are gems without any
So there are men who pass through the world with their souls full of poetry who would not believe you if you were to tell them so
Happy for them is their ignorance perhaps
La Fontaine came near being one of them
All that is artificial in poetry to him came late and with difficulty
Yet it resulted from his keen relish of nature that he was never satisfied with his art of verse till he had brought it to the confines of perfection
He did not philosophize over the animals he sympathized with them
A philosopher would not have lost a fashionable dinner in his admiration of a common
La Fontaine did so once because the little community was engaged in what he took to be a funeral
He could not in decency leave them till it was over
out of the question this was to be a genuine poet though with commonplace mortals it was also to be a fool

But we will first in few words despatch the worst for there is a very bad part of his life
It was not specially life it was the life of the age in which he lived
The man of strong amorous propensities in that age and country who was nevertheless faithful to vows of either marriage or celibacy the latter vows then proved sadly dangerous to the former may be regarded as a miracle
La Fontaine without any agency of his own affections found himself married at the age of while yet as immature as most men are at sixteen
The upshot was that his patrimony dwindled and though he lived many years with his wife and had a son he neglected her more and more till at last he forgot that he had been married though he unfortunately did not forget that there were other women in the world besides his wife
His genius and benevolence gained him friends everywhere with both sexes who never suffered him to want and who had never cause to complain of his ingratitude
But he was always the special favourite of the Aspasias who ruled France and her kings
To please them he wrote a great deal of fine poetry much of which deserves to be everlastingly forgotten
It must be said for him that his vice became conspicuous only in the light of one of his virtues
His frankness would never allow concealment
He scandalized his friends Boileau and Racine still it is matter of doubt whether they did not excel him rather in prudence than in purity
But whatever may be said in palliation it is lamentable to think that a genius should have been made in any way to minister to a vice which has caused unutterable woes to France and the world
Some time before he died he repented bitterly of this part of his course and laboured no doubt sincerely to repair the mischiefs he had done

As we have already said Jean was a backward boy
But under a dull exterior the mental machinery was working splendidly within
He lacked all that outside care and prudence that constant looking out for breakers which obstruct the growth and ripening of the reflective faculties
The vulgar by a queer mistake call a man when his mind shuts the door pulls in the and is wholly at home
La Fontaine mind was exceedingly domestic
It was nowhere but at home when riding from Paris to a bundle of papers fell from his without his perceiving it
The coming behind him picked it up and overtaking La Fontaine asked him if he had lost anything
Certainly not he replied looking about him with great surprise
Well I have just picked up these papers rejoined the other
Ah
they are mine cried La Fontaine they involve my whole estate
And he eagerly reached to take them
On another occasion he was equally at home
Stopping on a journey he ordered dinner at an hotel and then took a ramble about the town
On his return he entered another hotel and passing through into the garden took from his pocket a copy of Livy in which he quietly set himself to read till his dinner should be ready
The book made him forget his appetite till a servant informed him of his mistake and he returned to his hotel just in time to pay his bill and proceed on his journey

It will be perceived that he took the world quietly and his doing so undoubtedly had important bearings on his style
We give another anecdote which illustrates this peculiarity of his mind as well as the superlative folly of duelling
Not long after his marriage with all his indifference to his wife he was persuaded into a fit of singular jealousy
He was intimate with an of dragoons by name Poignant who had retired to a frank man but of extremely little gallantry
Whenever Poignant was not at his inn he was at La Fontaine and consequently with his wife when he himself was not at home
Some person took it in his head to ask La Fontaine why he suffered these constant visits
And why said La Fontaine should I not
He is my best friend
The public think otherwise was the reply they say that he comes for the sake of Madame La Fontaine
The public is mistaken but what must I do in the case
said the poet
You must demand satisfaction sword in hand of one who has dishonoured you
Very well said La Fontaine I will demand it
The next day he called on Poignant at four in the morning and found him in bed
Rise said he and come out with me
His friend asked him what was the matter and what pressing business had brought him so early in the morning
I shall let you know replied La Fontaine when we get abroad
Poignant in great astonishment rose followed him out and asked whither he was leading
You shall know replied La Fontaine and at last when they had reached a retired place he said My friend we must fight
Poignant still more surprised sought to know in what he had offended him and moreover represented to him that they were not on equal terms
I am a man of war said he while as for you you have never drawn a sword
No matter said La Fontaine the public requires that I should fight you
Poignant after having resisted in vain at last drew his sword and having easily made himself master of La Fontaine demanded the cause of the quarrel
The public maintains said La Fontaine that you come to my house daily not for my sake but my wife
Ah
my friend replied the other I should never have suspected that was the cause of your displeasure and I protest I will never again put a foot within your doors
On the contrary replied La Fontaine seizing him by the hand I have satisfied the public and now you must come to my house every day or I will fight you again
The two antagonists returned and breakfasted together in

It was not as we have said till his year that La Fontaine showed any taste for poetry
The occasion was this An officer in at one day read to him with great spirit an ode of Malherbe beginning thus

Que races futures Si quelquefois un vrai discours Vous récite les aventures De nos abominables jours

Or as we might paraphrase it
What will ye say ye future days If I for once in honest rhymes Recount to you the deeds and ways Of our abominable times

La Fontaine listened with involuntary transports of joy admiration and astonishment as if a man born with a genius for music but brought up in a desert had for the first time heard a instrument
He set himself immediately to reading Malherbe passed his nights in learning his verses by heart and his days in declaiming them in solitary places
He also read Voiture and began to write verses in imitation
Happily at this period a relative named Pintrel directed his attention to ancient literature and advised him to make himself familiar with Horace Homer Virgil Terence and Quinctilian
He accepted this counsel
de Maucroix another of his friends who cultivated poetry with success also contributed to confirm his taste for the ancient models
His great delight however was to read Plato and Plutarch which he did only through translations
The copies which he used are said to bear his manuscript notes on almost every page and these notes are the maxims which are to be found in his fables
Returning from this study of the ancients he read the moderns with more discrimination
His favourites besides Malherbe were Corneille Rabelais and Marot
In Italian he read Ariosto Boccaccio and Machiavel
In he published his first work a translation of the of Terence
It met with no success
But this does not seem at all to have disturbed its author
He cultivated with as much ardour and as ever and his verses soon began to be admired in the circle of his friends
No man had ever more devoted friends
Verses that have cost thought are not relished without thought
When a genius appears it takes some little time for the world to educate itself to a knowledge of the fact
By one of his friends La Fontaine was introduced to Fouquet the minister of finance a man of great power and who rivalled his sovereign in wealth and luxury
It was his pride to be the patron of literary men and he was pleased to make La Fontaine his poet settling on him a pension of one thousand francs per annum on condition that he should produce a piece in verse each quarter a condition which was exactly complied with till the fall of the minister

Fouquet was a most splendid villain and positively though perhaps not comparatively deserved to fall
But it was enough for La Fontaine that Fouquet had done him a kindness
He took the part of the disgraced minister without counting the cost
His Elegy to the nymphs of Vaux was a shield to the fallen man and turned popular hatred into sympathy
The poet rejoiced exceedingly in its success
was the appellation which his friends pleasantly gave him and by which he became known everywhere and never did a man better deserve it in its best sense
He was good by nature not by the calculation of consequences
Indeed it does not seem ever to have occurred to him that kindness gratitude and truth could have any other than good consequences
He was truly a Frenchman without guile and possessed to perfection that comfortable trait in which French character is commonly allowed to excel the English with the whole world

La Fontaine was the intimate friend of Molière Boileau and Racine
Molière had already established a reputation but the others became known to the world at the same time
Boileau hired a small chamber in the Faubourg Saint Germain where they all met several times a week for La Fontaine at the age of had left and become a citizen of Paris
Here they discussed all sorts of topics admitting to their society Chapelle a man of less genius but of greater conversational powers than either of them a sort of connecting link between them and the world
Four poets or four men could hardly have been more unlike
Boileau was blustering blunt peremptory but honest and frank Racine of a pleasant and tranquil gaiety but mischievous and sarcastic Molière was naturally considerate pensive and melancholy La Fontaine was often but sometimes exceedingly jovial delighting with his sallies his witty and his arch simplicity
These meetings which no doubt had a great influence upon French literature La Fontaine in one of his prefaces thus describes Four friends whose acquaintance had begun at the foot of Parnassus held a sort of society which I should call an Academy if their number had been sufficiently great and if they had had as much regard for the Muses as for pleasure
The first thing which they did was to banish from among them all rules of conversation and everything which savours of the academic conference
When they met and had sufficiently discussed their amusements if chance threw them upon any point of science or they profited by the occasion it was however without dwelling too long on the same subject flitting from one thing to another like the bees that meet divers sorts of flowers on their way
Neither envy malice nor cabal had any voice among them
They adored the works of the ancients never refused due praise to those of the moderns spoke modestly of their own and gave each other sincere counsel when any one of them which rarely happened fell into the malady of the age and published a book

The of our fabulist not unfrequently created much amusement on these occasions and made him the object of mirthful conspiracies
So keenly was the game pursued by Boileau and Racine that the more considerate Molière felt obliged sometimes to expose and rebuke them
Once after having done so he privately told a stranger who was present with them the wits would have worried themselves in vain they could not have obliterated the

La Fontaine as we have said was an admirer of Rabelais to what a pitch the following anecdote may show
At one of the meetings at Boileau were present Racine Valincourt and a brother of Boileau a doctor of the Sorbonne
The latter took it upon him to set forth the merits of Augustin in a pompous eulogium
La Fontaine plunged in one of his habitual reveries listened without hearing
At last rousing himself as if from a profound sleep to prove that the conversation had not been lost upon him he asked the doctor with a very serious air whether he thought Augustin had as much wit as Rabelais
The divine surprised looked at him from head to foot and only replied Take care Monsieur La Fontaine you have put one of your stockings on wrong side outwards which was the fact

It was in that La Fontaine published his first collection of fables under the modest title Choisies mises en in a quarto volume with figures designed and engraved by Chauveau
It contained six books and was dedicated to the Dauphin
Many of the fables had already been published in a separate form
The success of this collection was so great that it was reprinted the same year in a smaller size
Fables had come to be regarded as beneath poetry La Fontaine established them at once on the top of Parnassus
The ablest poets of his age did not think it beneath them to enter the lists with him and it is needless to say they came off second best

One of the fables of the first book is addressed to the Duke de la Rochefoucauld and was the consequence of a friendship between La Fontaine and the author of the celebrated Maxims
Connected with the duke was Madame La Fayette one of the most learned and ingenious women of her age who consequently became the admirer and friend of the fabulist
To her he wrote verses abundantly as he did to all who made him the object of their kind regard
Indeed notwithstanding his avowed indolence or rather passion for quiet and sleep his pen was very productive
In he published Psyché a romance in prose and verse which he dedicated to the Duchess de Bouillon in gratitude for many kindnesses
The prose is said to be better than the verse but this can hardly be true in respect to the following lines in which the poet under the apt name of Polyphile in a hymn addressed to Pleasure undoubtedly sketches himself
Volupté Volupté qui fus jadis maîtresse Du plus bel esprit de la Grèce Ne me dédaigne pas loger chez moi Tu seras pas sans emploi le jeu les livres la musique La ville et la campagne enfin tout il rien Qui ne me soit souverain bien sombre plaisir coeur mélancolique
Viens donc
The characteristic grace and playfulness of this seem to defy translation
To the mere English reader the sense may be roughly given thus
Delight Delight who didst as mistress hold The finest wit of Grecian mould Disdain not me but come And make my house thy home
Thou shalt not be without employ In play love music books I joy In town and country and indeed there nought to the luxury of sober thought The sombre melancholy mood But brings to me the sovereign good
Come then
The same Polyphile in recounting his adventures on a visit to the infernal regions tells us that he saw in the hands of the cruel Eumenides
Les auteurs de maint hymen forcé chiche et la dame au coeur intéressé La troupe des censeurs peuple à rebelle Ceux enfin dont les vers ont noirci quelque belle

Artificers of many a loveless match And lovers who but sought the pence to catch The crew censorious rebels against Love And those whose verses soiled the fair above

To be rebels against Love was quite unpardonable with La Fontaine and to bring about a was a crime of which he probably spoke with some personal feeling
The great popularity of Psyché encouraged the author to publish two volumes of poems and tales in in which were contained several new fables
The celebrated Madame de Sévigné thus speaks of these fables in one of her letters to her daughter But have you not admired the beauty of the five or six fables of La Fontaine contained in one of the volumes which I sent you
We were charmed with them the other day at de la Rochefoucauld we got by art that of the Monkey and the Cat
Then quoting some lines she adds This is painting
And the Pumpkin and the Nightingale they are worthy of the first volume
It was in his stories that La Fontaine excelled and Madame de Sévigné expresses a wish to invent a fable which would impress upon him the folly of leaving his peculiar province
He seemed himself not insensible where his strength lay and seldom ventured upon any other ground except at the instance of his friends
With all his lightness he felt a deep veneration for religion the most spiritual and rigid which came within the circle of his immediate acquaintance
He admired Jansenius and the Port Royalists and heartily loved Racine who was of their faith
Count de Loménie of Brienne who after being secretary of state had retired to the Oratoire was engaged in bringing out a better collection of Christian lyrics
To this work he pressed La Fontaine whom he called his particular friend to lend his name and contributions
Thus the author of Psyché Adonis and Joconde was led to the composition of pious hymns and versifications of the Psalms of David
Gifted by nature with the utmost frankness of disposition he sympathized fully with Arnauld and Pascal in the war against the Jesuits and it would seem from his sur that he had read and relished the Provincial Letters

BALLADE SUR ESCOBAR

à bon droit que condamne à Rome auteur de vains débats Ses sectateurs nous défendent en somme Tous les plaisirs que goûte

Il ne dit pas peut tuer un homme Qui sans raison nous tient en altercas Pour un fêtu ou bien pour une pomme Mais le peut pour quatre ou cinq ducats
Même il soutient peut en certains cas Faire un serment plein de supercherie aux douceurs de la vie est besoin conserver ses amours

the originator of the sect called Jansenists
Though he was bishop of Ypres his chief work Augustinus and his doctrines generally were condemned by Popes Urban VIII

This was Antoine Arnauld doctor of the Sorbonne and one of the Arnaulds famous among the Port Royalists who were Jansenists in opposition to the Jesuits
He was born in and died a voluntary exile in Belgium
Boileau wrote his Ed

The writer of this hasty Preface offers the following only as an attempted imitation
BALLAD UPON ESCOBAR

Good cause has Rome to reprobate The bishop who disputes her so His followers reject and hate All pleasures that we taste below
To heaven an easy pace may go Whatever crazy ARNAULD saith Who aims at pleasure causeless wrath
Seek we the better world afar

Although he does not say you can Should one with you for nothing strive Or for a trifle kill the man You can for ducats four or five
Indeed if circumstances drive Defraud or take false oaths you may Or to the charms of life give way When Love must needs the door unbar

The verses of La Fontaine did more for his reputation than for his purse
His paternal estate wasted away under his carelessness for when the ends of the year refused to meet he sold a piece of land sufficient to make them do so
His wife no better qualified to manage worldly gear than himself probably lived on her family friends who were able to support her and who seem to have done so without blaming him
She had lived with him in Paris for some time after that city became his abode but tiring at length of the city life she had returned at and occupied the family mansion
At the earnest expostulation of Boileau and Racine who wished to make him a better husband he returned to himself in for the purpose of becoming reconciled to his wife
But his purpose strangely vanished
He called at his own house learned from the domestic who did not know him that Madame La Fontaine was in good health and passed on to the house of a friend where he tarried two days and then returned to Paris without having seen his wife
When his friends inquired of him his success with some confusion he replied I have been to see her but I did not find her she was well
Twenty years after that Racine prevailed on him to visit his patrimonial estate to take some care of what remained
Racine not hearing from him sent to know what he was about when La Fontaine wrote as follows Poignant on his return from Paris told me that you took my silence in very bad part the worse because you had been told that I have been incessantly at work since my arrival at and that instead of applying myself to my affairs I have had nothing in my head but verses
All this is no more than half true my affairs occupy me as much as they deserve to that is to say not at all but the leisure which they leave me it is not poetry but idleness which makes away with it
On a certain occasion in the earlier part of his life when pressed in regard to his improvidence he gaily produced the following epigram which has commonly been appended to his fables as The Epitaph of La Fontaine written by Himself
Jean alla comme il était venu Mangea le fonds avec le revenu Tint les trésors chose peu nécessaire
Quant à son temps bien sut le dispenser Deux parts en fit do il soûloit passer à dormir et à ne rien faire

This confession the immortality of which was so little foreseen by its author liberally rendered amounts to the following
John went as he came ate his farm with its fruits Held treasure to be but the cause of disputes And as to his time be it frankly confessed Divided it daily as suited him best Gave a part to his sleep and to nothing the rest

It is clear that a man who provided so little for himself needed good friends to do it and Heaven kindly furnished them
When his affairs began to be straitened he was invited by the celebrated Madame de la Sablière to make her house his home and there in fact he was thoroughly domiciliated for twenty years
I have sent away all my domestics said that lady one day I have kept only my dog my cat and La Fontaine
She was perhaps the woman in France was the mistress of several languages knew Horace and Virgil by heart and had been thoroughly indoctrinated in all the sciences by the ablest masters
Her husband Rambouillet de la Sablière was secretary to the king and register of domains and to immense wealth united considerable poetical talents with a thorough knowledge of the world
It was the will of Madame de la Sablière that her favourite poet should have no further care for his external wants and never was a mortal more perfectly resigned
He did all honour to the sincerity of his amiable hostess and if he ever showed a want of independence he certainly did not of gratitude
Compliments of more touching tenderness we nowhere meet than those which La Fontaine has paid to his benefactress
He published nothing which was not first submitted to her eye and entered into her affairs and friendships with all his heart
Her unbounded confidence in his integrity she expressed by saying La Fontaine never lies in prose
By her death in our fabulist was left without a home but his many friends vied with each other which should next furnish one
He was then years of age had turned his attention to personal religion and received the seal of conversion at the hands of the Roman Catholic church
In his conversion as in the rest of his life his frankness left no room to doubt his sincerity
The writings which had justly given offence to the good were made the subject of a public confession and everything in his power was done to prevent their circulation
The death of one who had done so much for him and whose last days devoted with the most benevolence to the welfare of her species had taught him a most salutary lesson could not but be deeply felt
He had just left the house of his deceased benefactress never again to enter it when he met in the street who eagerly said to him My dear La Fontaine I was looking for you to beg you to come and take lodgings in my house
I was going thither replied La Fontaine
A reply could not have more characteristic
The fabulist had not in him sufficient hypocrisy of which to manufacture the commonplace politeness of society
His was the politeness of a warm and unsuspecting heart
He never concealed his confidence in the fear that it might turn out to be misplaced

His second collection of fables containing five books La Fontaine published in with a dedication to Madame de Montespan the previous six books were republished at the same time revised and enlarged
The twelfth book was not added till many years after and proved in fact the song of the dying swan
It was written for the special use of the young Duke de Bourgogne the royal pupil of Fénélon to whom it contains frequent allusions
The eleven books now published sealed the reputation of La Fontaine and were received with distinguished regard by the king who appended to the ordinary protocol or imprimatur for publication the following reasons in order to testify to the author the esteem we have for his person and his merit and because youth have received great advantage in their education from the fables selected and put in verse which he has heretofore published
The author was moreover permitted to present his book in person to the sovereign
For this purpose he repaired to Versailles and after having well delivered himself of his compliment to royalty perceived that he had forgotten to bring the book which he was to present he was nevertheless favourably received and loaded with presents
But it is added that on his return he also lost by his absence of mind the purse full of gold which the king had given him which was happily found under a cushion of the carriage in which he rode

In his advertisement to the second part of his Fables La Fontaine informs the reader that he had treated his subjects in a somewhat different style
In fact in his first collection he had timidly confined himself to the brevity of Aesop and Phaedrus but having observed that those fables were most popular in which he had given most scope to his own genius he threw off the trammels in the second collection and in the opinion of the writer much for the better
His subjects too in the second part are frequently derived from the Indian fabulists and bring with them the richness and dramatic interest of the

Of all his fables the Oak and the Reed is said to have been the favourite of La Fontaine
But his critics have almost unanimously given the palm of excellence to the Animals sick of the Plague the first of the seventh book
Its exquisite poetry the perfection of its dialogue and the weight of its moral well entitle it to the place
That must have been a soul replete with honesty which could read such a lesson in the ears of a proud and oppressive court
Indeed we may look in vain through this encyclopaedia of fable for a sentiment which goes to justify the strong in their oppression of the weak
Even in the midst of the fulsome compliments which it was the fashion of his age to pay to royalty La Fontaine maintains a reserve and decency peculiar to himself
By an examination of his fables we think we might fairly establish for him the character of an honest and disinterested lover and respecter of his species
In his fable entitled Death and the Dying he unites the genius of Pascal and Molière in that of the Two Doves is a tenderness quite peculiar to himself and an insight into the heart worthy of Shakspeare
In his Mogul Dream are sentiments worthy of the very of nature and expressed in his own native tongue with a felicity which makes the translator feel that all his labours are but vanity and vexation of spirit
But it is not the purpose of this brief Preface to criticize the Fables
It is sufficient to say that the work occupies a position in French literature which after all has been said that can be for Gay Moore and other English versifiers of fables is left quite vacant in ours

Our author was elected a member of the French Academy in and received with the honour of a public session
He read on this occasion a poem of exquisite beauty addressed to his benefactress Madame de la Sablière
In that distinguished body of men he was a universal favourite and none perhaps did more to promote its prime object the improvement of the French language
We have already seen how he was regarded by some of the greatest minds of his age
Voltaire who never did more than justice to merit other than his own said of the Fables I hardly know a book which more abounds with charms adapted to the people and at the same time to persons of refined taste
I believe that of all authors La Fontaine is the most universally read
He is for all minds and all ages
La Bruyère when admitted to the Academy in was warmly applauded for his upon La Fontaine which contained the following words More equal than Marot and more poetical than Voiture La Fontaine has the playfulness felicity and artlessness of both
He instructs while he sports persuades men to virtue by means of beasts and exalts trifling subjects to the sublime a man unique in his species of composition always original whether he invents or translates who has gone beyond his models himself a model hard to imitate

La Fontaine as we have said devoted his latter days to religion
In this he was sustained and cheered by his old friends Racine and De Maucroix
Death overtook him while applying his poetical powers to the hymns of the church
To De Maucroix he wrote a little before his death I assure you that the best of your friends can not count upon more than fifteen days of life
For these two months I have not gone abroad except occasionally to attend the Academy for a little amusement
Yesterday as I was returning from it in the middle of the Rue du Chantre I was taken with such a faintness that I really thought myself dying
O my friend to die is nothing but think you how I am going to appear before God
You know how I have lived
Before you receive this billet the gates of eternity will perhaps have been opened upon me
To this a few days after his friend replied If God in his kindness restores you to health I hope you will come and spend the rest of your life with me and we shall often talk together of the mercies of God
If however you have not strength to write beg Racine to do me that kindness the greatest he can ever do for me
Adieu my good my old and my true friend
May God in his infinite goodness take care of the health of your body and that of your soul
He died the of April at the age of and was buried in the cemetery of the

When Fénélon heard of his death he wrote a Latin eulogium which he gave to his royal pupil to translate
La Fontaine is no more
said Fénélon in this composition he is no more
and with him have gone the playful jokes the merry laugh the artless graces and the sweet Muses


THE FABLES OF LA FONTAINE

To Monseigneur The Dauphin

I sing the heroes of old Aesop line Whose tale though false when strictly we define Containeth truths it were not ill to teach
With me all natures use the gift of speech Yea in my work the very fishes preach And to our human selves their sermons suit
is thus to come at man I use the brute

Son of a Prince the favourite of the skies On whom the world entire hath fix its eyes Who hence shall count his conquests by his days And gather from the proudest lips his praise A louder voice than mine must tell in song What virtues to thy kingly line belong
I seek thine ear to gain by lighter themes Slight pictures deck in magic nature beams And if to please thee shall not be my pride I gain at least the praise of having tried

This dedication prefaced La Fontaine first collection of his Fables which comprised Books to published in
The Dauphin was Louis the only son of Louis XIV
and of Austria
He was born at Fontainebleau in and died at Meudon in before his father the Grand Monarque had ceased to reign
The Dauphin being but a child between six and seven years old at the time of this dedication La Fontaine act may be viewed rather as an offering to the King than to the child himself

THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE ANT

A Grasshopper gay Sang the summer away And found herself poor By the winter first roar
Of meat or of bread Not a morsel she had
So a begging she went To her neighbour the ant For the loan of some wheat Which would serve her to eat Till the season came round
will pay you she saith an animal faith Double weight in the pound Ere the harvest be bound
The ant is a friend And here she might mend Little given to lend
spent you the summer
Quoth she looking shame At the borrowing dame
and day to each comer I sang if you please
sang
I at ease For is plain at a glance Now you must dance

For the story of this fable as for the stories of so many of the fables which follow especially in the first six books La Fontaine is indebted to the Father of Fable Aesop the Phrygian

THE RAVEN AND THE FOX

Perch on a lofty oak Sir Raven held a lunch of cheese Sir Fox who smelt it in the breeze Thus to the holder spoke
how do you do Sir Raven
Well your coat sir is a brave one
So black and glossy on my word sir With voice to match you were a bird sir Well fit to be the Phoenix of these days
Sir Raven overset with praise Must show how musical his croak
Down fell the luncheon from the oak Which snatching up Sir Fox thus spoke flatterer my good sir Aye liveth on his listener Which lesson if you please Is doubtless worth the cheese
A bit too late Sir Raven swore The rogue should never cheat him more

Both Aesop and Phaedrus have a version of this fable


THE FROG THAT WISHED TO BE AS BIG AS THE OX

The tenant of a bog An envious little frog Not bigger than an egg A stately bullock spies And smitten with his size Attempts to be as big
With earnestness and pains She stretches swells and strains And says Frog look here
see me
Is this enough
no
then is this

poh
Enough
you do begin to be
And thus the reptile sits Enlarging till she splits
The world is full of folks Of just such wisdom The lordly dome provokes The cit to build his dome And really there is no telling How much great men set little ones a swelling

The story of this fable is given in Horace II
Phaedrus and Corrozet have also versions of it

Gilles Corrozet was one of the French fabulists immediately preceding La Fontaine
He was a Parisian who lived between and

THE TWO MULES

Two mules were bearing on their backs One oats the other silver of the tax
The latter glorying in his load March proudly forward on the road And from the jingle of his bell was plain he liked his burden well
But in a glen A band of robber men Rush forth upon the twain
Well with the silver pleased They by the bridle seized The so vain
Poor mule
in struggling to repel His ruthless foes he fell Stabb through and with a bitter sighing He cried this the lot they promised me
My humble friend from danger free While weltering in my gore I dying
friend his replied is not well to have one work too high
If thou hadst been a miller drudge as I Thou wouldst not thus have died

Its collection caused several peasants insurrections


THE WOLF AND THE DOG

A prowling wolf whose shaggy skin So strict the watch of dogs had been Hid little but his bones Once met a mastiff dog astray
A prouder fatter sleeker Tray No human mortal owns
Sir Wolf in famish plight Would fain have made a ration Upon his fat relation But then he first must fight And well the dog seem able To save from wolfish table His carcass snug and tight
So then in civil conversation The wolf express his admiration Of Tray fine case
Said Tray politely good sir may be as sightly Quit but the woods advised by me
For all your fellows here I see Are shabby wretches lean and gaunt Belike to die of haggard want
With such a pack of course it follows One fights for every bit he swallows
Come then with me and share On equal terms our princely fare
what with you Has one to do
Inquires the wolf
work indeed Replies the dog only need To bark a little now and then To chase off duns and beggar men To fawn on friends that come or go forth Your master please and so forth For which you have to eat All sorts of meat Cold pullets pigeons savoury messes Besides unnumber fond caresses
The wolf by force of appetite Accepts the terms outright Tears glistening in his eyes
But faring on he spies A gall spot on the mastiff neck
that
he cries
nothing but a speck
speck
ay is not enough to pain me Perhaps the collar mark by which they chain me

chain you
What
run you not then Just where you please and when
always sir but what of that
for me to spoil your fat
It ought to be a precious price Which could to servile chains entice For me I shun them while I wit
So ran Sir Wolf and runneth yet

THE HEIFER THE GOAT AND THE SHEEP IN COMPANY WITH THE LION

The heifer the goat and their sister the sheep Compacted their earnings in common to keep is said in time past with a lion who sway Full lordship neighbours of whatever grade
The goat as it happen a stag having snared Sent off to the rest that the beast might be shared
All gather the lion first counts on his claws And says proceed to divide with our paws The stag into pieces as fix by our laws
This done he announces part first as his own mine he says as lion alone
To such a decision there nought to be said As he who has made it is doubtless the head
also the second to me should belong is mine be it known by the right of the strong
Again as the bravest the third must be mine
To touch but the fourth whoso maketh a sign I choke him to death In the space of a breath

Phaedrus I

From this fable come the French proverbial expression part du and its English equivalent the lion share


THE WALLET

From heaven one day did Jupiter proclaim all that live before my throne appear And there if any one hath aught to blame In matter form or texture of his frame He may bring forth his grievance without fear
Redress shall instantly be given to each
Come monkey now first let us have your speech
You see these quadrupeds your brothers Comparing then yourself with others Are you well satisfied
wherefore not
Says Jock
I four trotters with the rest
Is not my visage comely as the best
But this my brother Bruin is a blot On thy creation fair And sooner than be painted I be shot Were I great sire a bear
The bear approaching doth he make complaint
Not he himself he lauds without restraint
The elephant he needs must criticize To crop his ears and stretch his tail were wise A creature he of huge misshapen size
The elephant though famed as beast judicious While on his own account he had no wishes Pronounced dame whale too big to suit his taste Of flesh and fat she was a perfect waste
The little ant again pronounced the gnat too wee To such a speck a vast colossus she
Each censured by the rest himself content Back to their homes all living things were sent
Such folly liveth yet with human fools
For others lynxes for ourselves but moles
Great blemishes in other men we spy Which in ourselves we pass most kindly by
As in this world we but Kind Heaven has made us
The pouch behind our own defects must store The faults of others lodge in that before

One of Aesop Phaedrus also gives it Book IV


THE SWALLOW AND THE LITTLE BIRDS

By voyages in air With constant thought and care Much knowledge had a swallow gain Which she for public use retain The slightest storms she well foreknew And told the sailors ere they blew
A farmer sowing hemp once having found She gather all the little birds around And said friends the freedom let me take To prophesy a little for your sake Against this dangerous seed
Though such a bird as I Knows how to hide or fly You birds a caution need
See you that waving hand
It scatters on the land What well may cause alarm
grow to nets and snares To catch you unawares And work you fatal harm
Great multitudes I fear Of you my birdies dear That falling seed so little Will bring to cage or kettle
But though so perilous the plot You now may easily defeat it All lighting on the seeded spot Just scratch up every seed and eat it
The little birds took little heed So fed were they with other seed
Anon the field was seen Bedeck in tender green
The swallow warning voice was heard again friends the product of that deadly grain Seize now and pull it root by root Or surely you repent its fruit
babbling prophetess says one set us at some pretty fun
To pull this field a thousand birds are needed While thousands more with hemp are seeded
The crop now quite mature The swallow adds far I fail of cure I prophesied in vain Against this fatal grain It grown
And now my bonny birds Though you have disbelieved my words Thus far take heed at last When you shall see the past And men no crops to labour for On birds shall wage their cruel war With deadly net and noose Of flying then beware Unless you take the air Like woodcock crane or goose
But stop you not in plight For such adventurous flight desert waves and sands In search of other lands
Hence then to save your precious souls Remaineth but to say be the safest way To chuck yourselves in holes
Before she had thus far gone The birdlings tired of hearing And laughing more than fearing Set up a greater jargon Than did before the Trojan slaughter The Trojans round old Priam daughter
And many a bird in prison grate Lamented soon a Trojan fate

is thus we heed no instincts but our own Believe no evil till the evil done

Aesop
Cassandra who predicted the fall of Troy and was not heeded


THE CITY RAT AND THE COUNTRY RAT

A city rat one night Did with a civil stoop A country rat invite To end a turtle soup

Upon a Turkey carpet They found the table spread And sure I need not harp it How well the fellows fed

The entertainment was A truly noble one But some unlucky cause Disturb it when begun

It was a slight That put their joys to rout Out ran the city rat His guest too scamper out

Our rats but fairly quit The fearful knocking ceased
we cried the cit To finish there our feast

said the rustic rat dine with me
I not offended at Your feast so grand and free
I no fare resembling But then I eat at leisure And would not swap for pleasure So mix with fear and trembling

Horace II
also in Aesop


THE WOLF AND THE LAMB

That innocence is not a shield A story teaches not the longest
The strongest reasons always yield To reasons of the strongest

A lamb her thirst was slaking Once at a mountain rill
A hungry wolf was taking His hunt for sheep to kill When spying on the streamlet brink This sheep of tender age He howl in tones of rage dare you roil my drink
Your impudence I shall chastise
not your majesty the lamb replies in haste or passion
For sure is difficult to think In what respect or fashion My drinking here could roil your drink Since on the stream your majesty now faces I lower down full twenty paces
roil it said the wolf more I know You cursed and slander me a year ago
no
how could I such a thing have done
A lamb that has not seen a year A suckling of its mother dear
brother then
brother I have none
well what all the same was some one of your name
Sheep men and dogs of every nation Are wont to stab my reputation As I have truly heard
Without another word He made his vengeance good Bore off the lambkin to the wood And there without a jury Judged slew and ate her in his fury

Phaedrus I

THE MAN AND HIS IMAGE

To The Duke De La Rochefoucauld

A man who had no rivals in the love Which to himself he bore Esteem his own dear beauty far above What earth had seen before
More than contented in his error He lived the foe of every mirror
Officious fate resolved our lover From such an illness should recover Presented always to his eyes The mute advisers which the ladies prize Mirrors in parlours inns and shops Mirrors the pocket furniture of fops Mirrors on every lady zone From which his face reflected shone
What could our dear Narcissus do
From haunts of men he now withdrew On purpose that his precious shape From every mirror might escape
But in his forest glen alone Apart from human trace A watercourse Of purest source While with unconscious gaze He pierced its waveless face Reflected back his own
Incensed with mingled rage and fright He seeks to shun the odious sight But yet that mirror sheet so clear and still He can not leave do what he will

Ere this my story drift you plainly see
From such mistake there is no mortal free
That obstinate The human soul doth cover The mirrors follies are of others In which as all are genuine brothers Each soul may see to life depicted Itself with just such faults afflicted And by that charming placid brook Needless to say I mean your Maxim Book

This is one of La Fontaine most admired fables and is one of the few for which he did not go for the groundwork to some older fabulist
The Duke de la Rochefoucauld to whom it was dedicated was the author of the famous Reflexions et Maximes Morales which La Fontaine praises in the last lines of his fable
La Rochefoucauld was La Fontaine friend and patron
The Maximes had achieved a second edition just prior to La Fontaine publication of this first series of his Fables in
The Rabbits Book Fable
published in the second collection in is also dedicated to the Duke who died the following year
See Translator Preface
One of La Fontaine commentators remarks upon this passage that it is no exaggeration of the foppishness of the times in which the poet wrote and cites the instance that the canons of Martin of Tours wore mirrors on their shoes even while officiating in church


THE DRAGON WITH MANY HEADS AND THE DRAGON WITH MANY TAILS

An envoy of the Porte Sublime As history says once on a time Before th imperial German court Did rather boastfully report The troops commanded by his master firman As being a stronger army than the German To which replied a Dutch attendant prince has more than one dependant Who keeps an army at his own expense
The Turk a man of sense Rejoin am aware What power your emperor servants share
It brings to mind a tale both strange and true A thing which once myself I chanced to view
I saw come darting through a hedge Which fortified a rocky ledge A hydra hundred heads and in a trice My blood was turning into ice
But less the harm than terror The body came no nearer Nor could unless it had been sunder To parts at least a hundred
While musing deeply on this sight Another dragon came to light Whose single head avails To lead a hundred tails And seized with juster fright I saw him pass the hedge Head body tails a wedge Of living and resistless The other was your emperor force this ours

The original of this fable has been attributed to the chief who made himself Emperor of Tartary and called himself Ghengis Khan
He is said to have applied the fable to the Great Mogul and his innumerable dependent potentates
The court of the Holy Roman Empire is here meant


THE THIEVES AND THE ASS

Two thieves pursuing their profession Had of a donkey got possession Whereon a strife arose Which went from words to blows
The question was to sell or not to sell But while our sturdy champions fought it well Another thief who chanced to pass With ready wit rode off the ass

This ass is by interpretation Some province poor or prostrate nation
The thieves are princes this and that On spoils and plunder prone to fat As those of Austria Turkey Hungary
Instead of two I quoted three Enough of such commodity
These powers engaged in war all Some fourth thief stops the quarrel According all to one key By riding off the donkey

SIMONIDES PRESERVED BY THE GODS

Three sorts there are as Malherbe says Which one can never overpraise The gods the ladies and the king And I for one endorse the thing
The heart praise tickles and entices Of fair one smile it oft the price is
See how the gods sometimes repay it
Simonides the ancients say it Once undertook in poem lyric To write a wrestler panegyric Which ere he had proceeded far in He found his subject somewhat barren
No ancestors of great renown His sire of some unnoted town Himself as little known to fame The wrestler praise was rather tame
The poet having made the most of his hero had to boast of Digress by choice that was not all luck To Castor and his brother Pollux Whose bright career was subject ample For wrestlers sure a good example
Our poet fatten on their story Gave every fight its place and glory Till of his panegyric words These deities had got
All done the poet fee A talent was to be
But when he comes his bill to settle The wrestler with a spice of mettle Pays down a third and tells the poet balance they may pay who owe it
The gods than I are rather debtors To such a pious man of letters
But still I shall be greatly pleased To have your presence at my feast Among a knot of guests select My kin and friends I most respect
More fond of character than coffer Simonides accepts the offer
While at the feast the party sit And wine provokes the flow of wit It is announced that at the gate Two men in haste that can not wait Would see the bard
He leaves the table No loss at all to noisy gabble
The men were Leda twins who knew What to a poet praise was due And thanking paid him by foretelling The downfall of the wrestler dwelling
From which pile indeed No sooner was the poet freed Than props and pillars failing Which held aloft the ceiling So splendid them It downward loudly crash The plates and flagons dash And men who bore them And what was worse Full vengeance for the man of verse A timber broke the wrestler thighs And wounded many otherwise
The gossip Fame of course took care Abroad to publish this affair
miracle
the public cried delighted
No more could bard be slighted
His verse now brought him more than double With neither duns nor care nor trouble
laid claim to noble birth Must buy his ancestors a slice Resolved no nobleman on earth Should overgo him in the price
From which these serious lessons flow Fail not your praises to bestow On gods and godlike men
Again To sell the product of her pain Is not degrading to the Muse
Indeed her art they do abuse Who think her wares to use And yet a liberal pay refuse
the great confer upon her They honour by it while they honour
Of old Olympus and Parnassus In friendship heaved their masses

DEATH AND THE UNFORTUNATE

A poor unfortunate from day to day Call Death to take him from this world away
Death he said me how fair thy form
Come quick and end for me life cruel storm
Death heard and with a ghastly grin Knock at his door and enter in out this object from my sight
The poor man loudly cried
dreadful looks I ca abide O stay him stay him let him come no nigher O Death
O Death
I pray thee to retire

A gentleman of note In Rome Maecenas somewhere wrote Make me the poorest wretch that begs Sore hungry crippled clothed in rags In hopeless impotence of arms and legs Provided after all you give The one sweet liberty to live I ask of Death no greater favour Than just to stay away for ever

Aesop
Seneca Epistles CI


DEATH AND THE WOODMAN

A poor with his fagot load Whom weight of years as well as load oppress Sore groaning in his smoky hut to rest Trudged wearily along his homeward road
At last his wood upon the ground he throws And sits him down to think all his woes
To joy a stranger since his hapless birth What poorer wretch upon this rolling earth
No bread sometimes and a moment rest Wife children soldiers landlords public tax All wait the swinging of his old worn axe And paint the veriest picture of a man unblest
On Death he calls
Forthwith that monarch grim Appears and asks what he should do for him
much indeed a little help I lack To put these fagots on my back

Death ready stands all ills to cure But let us not his cure invite
Than die is better to endure Is both a manly maxim and a right

Aesop it is also in Corrozet fables


THE MAN BETWEEN TWO AGES AND HIS TWO MISTRESSES

A man of middle age whose hair Was bordering on the grey Began to turn his thoughts and care The matrimonial way
By virtue of his ready A store of choices had he Of ladies bent to suit his taste On which account he made no haste
To court well was no trifling art
Two widows chiefly gain his heart The one yet green the other more mature Who found for nature wane in art a cure
These dames amidst their joking and caressing The man they long to wed Would sometimes set themselves to dressing His head
Each aiming to assimilate Her lover to her own estate The older piecemeal stole The black hair from his poll While eke with fingers light The young one stole the white
Between them both as if by scald His head was changed from grey to bald
these he said gentle pranks I owe you ladies many thanks
By being thus well shaved I less have lost than saved
Of Hymen yet no news at hand I do assure ye
By what I lost I understand It is in your way Not mine that I must pass on
Thanks ladies for the lesson

Phaedrus Aesop


THE FOX AND THE STORK

Old Mister Fox was at expense one day To dine old Mistress Stork
The fare was light was nothing sooth to say Requiring knife and fork
That sly old gentleman the Was you must understand a frugal liver
This once at least the total matter Was thinnish soup served on a platter For madam slender beak a fruitless puzzle Till all had pass the fox lapping muzzle
But little relishing his laughter Old gossip Stork some few days after Return his Foxship invitation
Without a moment hesitation He said he go for he must own he stood with friends for ceremony
And so precisely at the hour He hied him to the lady bower Where praising her politeness He finds her dinner right nice
Its punctuality and plenty Its viands cut in mouthfuls dainty Its fragrant smell were powerful to excite Had there been need his foxish appetite
But now the dame to torture him Such wit was in her Served up her dinner In vases made so tall and slim They let their owner beak pass in and out But not by any means the fox snout
All arts without avail With drooping head and tail As ought a fox a fowl had cheated The hungry guest at last retreated

Ye knaves for you is this recital You often meet Dame Stork requital

THE BOY AND THE SCHOOLMASTER

Wise counsel is not always wise As this my tale exemplifies
A boy that frolick on the banks of Seine Fell in and would have found a watery grave Had not that hand that planteth in vain A willow planted there his life to save
While hanging by its branches as he might A certain sage preceptor came in sight To whom the urchin cried or I drown
The master turning gravely at the sound Thought proper for a while to stand aloof And give the boy some seasonable reproof
little wretch
this comes of foolish playing Commands and precepts disobeying
A naughty rogue no doubt you are Who thus requite your parents care
Alas
their lot I pity much Whom fate condemns to watch such
This having coolly said and more He pull the drowning lad ashore

This story hits more marks than you suppose
All critics pedants men of endless prose Three sorts so richly bless with progeny The house is bless that doth not lodge any May in it see themselves from head to toes
No matter what the task Their precious tongues must teach Their help in need you ask You first must hear them preach

A fable telling this story is in the collection of Arabic fables which bear the name of Locman or Lokman a personage some identify with Aesop himself
Lokman is said to have flourished about
and even as the Phrygian slave Aesop was said to have been very ugly so Lokman is described as an ugly black slave

Rabelais also has a version of the story of this fable Book ch

THE COCK AND THE PEARL

A cock scratch up one day A pearl of purest ray Which to a jeweller he bore

So did a dunce inherit A manuscript of merit Which to a publisher he bore
good said he told Yet any coin of gold To me were worth a great deal more

THE HORNETS AND THE BEES

The artist by his work is known
A piece of one day Discover as a waif and stray The hornets treated as their own
Their title did the bees dispute And brought before a wasp the suit
The judge was puzzled to decide For nothing could be testified Save that around this There had been seen as if at home Some longish brownish buzzing creatures Much like the bees in wings and features
But what of that
for marks the same The hornets too could truly claim
Between assertion and denial The wasp in doubt proclaim new trial And hearing what an swore Could see no clearer than before
use I pray of this expense
At last exclaim a bee of sense
labour months in this affair And now are only where we were
Meanwhile the honey runs to waste is time the judge should show some haste
The parties sure have had sufficient bleeding Without more fuss of scrawls and pleading
Let set ourselves at work these drones and we And then all eyes the truth may plainly see Whose art it is that can produce The magic cells the nectar juice
The hornets flinching on their part Show that the work transcends their art
The wasp at length their title sees And gives the honey to the bees
Would God that suits at laws with us Might all be managed thus
That we might in the Turkish mode Have simple common sense for code
They then were short and cheap affairs Instead of stretching on like ditches Ingulfing in their course all riches The parties leaving for their shares The shells and shells there might be moister From which the court has suck the oyster

THE OAK AND THE REED

The oak one day address the reed you ungenerous indeed Has nature been my humble friend With weakness aye obliged to bend
The smallest bird that flits in air Is quite too much for you to bear The slightest wind that wreathes the lake Your head doth shake
The while my towering form Dares with the mountain top The solar blaze to stop And wrestle with the storm
What seems to you the blast of death To me is but a zephyr breath
Beneath my branches had you grown That spread far round their friendly bower Less suffering would your life have known Defended from the tempest power
Unhappily you oftenest show In open air your slender form Along the marshes wet and low That fringe the kingdom of the storm
To you declare I must Dame Nature seems unjust
Then modestly replied the reed pity sir is kind indeed But wholly needless for my sake
The wildest wind that ever blew Is safe to me compared with you
I bend indeed but never break
Thus far I own the hurricane Has beat your sturdy back in vain But wait the end
Just at the word The tempest hollow voice was heard
The North sent forth her fiercest child Dark jagged pitiless and wild
The oak erect endured the blow The reed bow gracefully and low
But gathering up its strength once more In greater fury than before The savage blast at last That proud old head Whose feet entwined the empire of the dead

The groundwork of this fable is in Aesop and also in the Fables of Avianus
Flavius Avianus lived in the fifth century
His Aesopian Fables were written in Latin verse
Caxton printed The Fables of Avian translated into Englyshe at the end of his edition of Aesop
This fable and The Animals Sick of the Plague Fable Book VII
are generally deemed La Fontaine two best fables
The Oak and the Reed is held to be the perfection of classical fable while The Animals Sick of the Plague is esteemed for its fine poetic feeling conjoined with its excellent moral teaching

BOOK II

AGAINST THE HARD TO SUIT

Were I a pet of fair Calliope I would devote the gifts conferr on me To dress in verse old Aesop lies divine For verse and they and truth do well combine But not a favourite on the Muses hill I dare not arrogate the magic skill To ornament these charming stories
A bard might brighten up their glories No doubt
I try what one more wise must do
Thus much I have accomplish hitherto By help of my translation The beasts hold conversation In French as they did before
Indeed to claim a little more The plants and trees with smiling features Are turn by me to talking creatures
Who says that this is not enchanting
says the critics what vaunting
From one whose work all told no more is Than baby stories
Would you a theme more credible my censors In graver tone and style which now and then soars
Then list
For ten long years the men of Troy By means that only heroes can employ Had held the allied hosts of Greece at bay Their minings batterings stormings day by day Their hundred battles on the crimson plain Their blood of thousand heroes all in vain When by Minerva art a horse of wood Of lofty size before their city stood Whose flanks immense the sage Ulysses hold Brave Diomed and Ajax fierce and bold Whom with their myrmidons the huge machine Would bear within the fated town unseen To wreak upon its very gods their rage stratagem in any age
Which well its crafty authors did repay enough our critic folks will say period excites alarm Lest you should do your lungs some harm And then your monstrous wooden horse With squadrons in it at their ease Is even harder to endorse Than Renard cheating Raven of his cheese
And more than that it fits you ill To wield the old heroic quill
Well then a humbler tone if such your will is Long sigh and pined the jealous Amaryllis For her Alcippus in the sad belief None save her sheep and dog would know her grief
Thyrsis who knows among the willows slips And hears the gentle shepherdess lips Beseech the kind and gentle zephyr To bear these accents to her lover

says my censor laws of rhyme quite irreducible That couplet needs again the crucible Poetic men sir Must nicely shun the shocks Of rhymes unorthodox
A curse on critics
hold your tongue
Know I not how to end my song
Of time and strength what greater waste Than my attempt to suit your taste

Some men more nice than wise There nought that satisfies

Phaedrus Book IV

plants and Aristotle rule for pure fable is that its should be animals only excluding man
Johnson writing upon Gay Fables agrees in this dictum generally
But hardly any of the fabulists from Aesop downwards seem to have bound themselves by the rule and in this fable we have La Fontaine rather exulting in his assignment of speech not only to the lower animals but to plants and trees as well as otherwise defying the hard to suit the critics
baby Here La Fontaine exalts his muse as a fabulist
This is in reply to certain of his critics who pronounced his work puerile and pretended to wish him to adopt the higher forms of poetry
Some of the fables of the first six Books were originally published in a way before

THE COUNCIL HELD BY THE RATS
Old Rodilard a certain cat Such havoc of the rats had made was difficult to find a rat With nature debt unpaid
The few that did remain To leave their holes afraid From usual food abstain Not eating half their fill
And wonder no one will That one who made of rats his revel With rats pass not for cat but devil
Now on a day this dread Who had a wife went out to meet her And while he held his caterwauling The unkill rats their chapter calling Discuss the point in grave debate How they might shun impending fate
Their dean a prudent rat Thought best and better soon than late To bell the fatal cat That when he took his hunting round The rats well caution by the sound Might hide in safety under ground Indeed he knew no other means
And all the rest At once confess Their minds were with the dean
No better plan they all believed Could possibly have been conceived No doubt the thing would work right well If any one would hang the bell
But one by one said every rat not so big a fool as that
The plan knock up in this respect The council closed without effect

And many a council I have seen Or reverend chapter with its dean That thus resolving wisely Fell through like this precisely

To argue or refute Wise counsellors abound The man to execute Is harder to be found

Faerno and Abstemius both have fables upon this subject
Gabriel Faerno was an Italian writer who published fables in Latin
Perrault translated these into French verse and published them at Paris in
Faerno was also a famous editor of Terence
Laurentius Abstemius or Astemio was an Italian fabulist of the fifteenth century
After their first publication his fables often appeared in editions of Aesop

THE WOLF ACCUSING THE FOX BEFORE THE MONKEY

A wolf affirming his belief That he had suffer by a thief Brought up his neighbour fox Of whom it was by all confess His character was not the best To fill the prisoner box
As judge between these vermin A monkey graced the ermine And truly other gifts of Themis Did scarcely seem his For while each party plead his cause Appealing boldly to the laws And much the question vex Our monkey sat perplex
Their words and wrath expended Their strife at length was ended When by their malice taught The judge this judgment brought characters my friends I long have known As on this trial clearly shown And hence I fine you both the grounds at large To state would little profit You wolf in short as bringing groundless charge You fox as guilty of it

Come at it right or wrong the judge opined No other than a villain could be fined

THE TWO BULLS AND THE FROG

Two bulls engaged in shocking battle Both for a certain heifer sake And lordship over certain cattle A frog began to groan and quake
what is this to you
Inquired another of the croaking crew
sister do you see The end of this will be That one of these big brutes will yield And then be exiled from the field
No more permitted on the grass to feed He forage through our marsh on rush and reed And while he eats or chews the cud Will trample on us in the mud
Alas
to think how frogs must suffer By means of this proud lady heifer
This fear was not without good sense
One bull was beat and much to their expense For quick retreating to their reedy bower He trod on twenty of them in an hour

Of little folks it oft has been the fate To suffer for the follies of the great

THE BAT AND THE TWO WEASELS

A blundering bat once stuck her head Into a wakeful weasel bed Whereat the mistress of the house A deadly foe of rats and mice Was making ready in a trice To eat the stranger as a mouse

do you dare she said creep in The very bed I sometimes sleep in Now after all the provocation I suffer from your thievish nation
Are you not really a mouse That gnawing pest of every house Your special aim to do the cheese ill
Ay that you are or I no weasel
beg your pardon said the bat kind is very far from that
What
I a mouse
Who told you such a lie
Why I am a bird And if you doubt my word Just see the wings with which I fly
Long live the mice that cleave the sky
These reasons had so fair a show The weasel let the creature go

By some strange fancy led The same wise blunderhead But two or three days later Had chosen for her rest Another weasel nest This last of birds a special hater
New peril brought this step absurd Without a moment thought or puzzle Dame weasel oped her peaked muzzle To eat th intruder as a bird

do not wrong me cried the bat truly no such thing as that
Your eyesight strange conclusions gathers
What makes a bird I pray
Its feathers
I cousin of the mice and rats
Great Jupiter confound the cats
The bat by such adroit replying Twice saved herself from dying

And many a human stranger Thus turns his coat in danger And sings as suits he goes save the king
or his foes

Aesop
save his foes La Fontaine last line is Vive le roi
Vive la ligue

THE BITCH AND HER FRIEND

A bitch that felt her time approaching And had no place for parturition Went to a female friend and broaching Her delicate condition Got leave herself to shut Within the other hut
At proper time the lender came Her little premises to claim
The bitch crawl meekly to the door And humbly begg a fortnight more
Her little pups she said could hardly walk
In short the lender yielded to her talk
The second term expired the friend had come To take possession of her house and home
The bitch this time as if she would have bit her Replied ready madam with my litter To go when you can turn me out
Her pups you see were fierce and stout

The creditor from whom a villain borrows Will fewer shillings get again than sorrows
If you have trusted people of this sort You have to plead and dun and fight in short If in your house you let one step a foot He surely step the other in to boot

THE EAGLE AND THE BEETLE

John Rabbit by Dame Eagle chased Was making for his hole in haste When on his way he met a beetle burrow
I leave you all to think If such a little chink Could to a rabbit give protection thorough
But since no better could be got John Rabbit there was fain to squat
Of course in an asylum so absurd John felt ere long the talons of the bird
But first the beetle interceding cried queen of birds it can not be denied That maugre my protection you can bear My trembling guest John Rabbit through the air
But do not give me such affront I pray And since he craves your grace In pity of his case Grant him his life or take us both away For he my gossip friend and neighbour
In vain the beetle friendly labour The eagle clutch her prey without reply And as she flapp her vasty wings to fly Struck down our orator and still him The wonder is she had kill him
The beetle soon of sweet revenge in quest Flew to the old gnarl mountain oak Which proudly bore that haughty eagle nest
And while the bird was gone Her eggs her cherish eggs he broke Not sparing one
Returning from her flight the eagle cry Of rage and bitter anguish fill the sky
But by excess of passion blind Her enemy she fail to find
Her wrath in vain that year it was her fate To live a mourning mother desolate
The next she built a loftier nest was vain The beetle found and dash her eggs again
John Rabbit death was thus revenged anew
The second mourning for her murder brood Was such that through the giant mountain wood For six long months the sleepless echo flew
The bird once Ganymede now made Her prayer to Jupiter for aid And laying them within his godship lap She thought her eggs now safe from all mishap The god his own could not but make them No wretch would venture there to break them
And no one did
Their enemy this time Upsoaring to a place sublime Let fall upon his royal robes some dirt Which Jove just shaking with a sudden flirt Threw out the eggs no one knows whither
When Jupiter inform her how th event Occurr by purest accident The eagle raved there was no reasoning with her She gave out threats of leaving court To make the desert her resort And other of this sort
Poor Jupiter in silence heard The uproar of his favourite bird
Before his throne the beetle now appear And by a clear complaint the mystery clear
The god pronounced the eagle in the wrong
But still their hatred was so old and strong These enemies could not be reconciled And that the general peace might not be spoil The best that he could do the god arranged That thence the eagle pairing should be changed To come when beetle folks are only found Conceal and dormant under ground

THE LION AND THE GNAT

paltry insect nature meanest brat
Thus said the royal lion to the gnat
The gnat declared immediate war
you said he royal name To me worth caring for
Think you I tremble at your power or fame
The ox is bigger far than you Yet him I drive and all his crew
This said as one that did no fear owe Himself he blew the battle charge Himself both trumpeter and hero
At first he play about at large Then on the lion neck at leisure settled And there the royal beast full sorely nettled
With foaming mouth and flashing eye He roars
All creatures hide or fly Such mortal terror at The work of one poor gnat
With constant change of his attack The snout now stinging now the back And now the chambers of the nose The pigmy fly no mercy shows
The lion rage was at its height His viewless foe now laugh outright When on his he saw That every savage tooth and claw Had got its proper beauty By doing bloody duty Himself the hapless lion tore his hide And lash with sounding tail from side to side
Ah
bootless blow and bite and curse
He beat the harmless air and worse For though so fierce and stout By effort wearied out He fainted fell gave up the quarrel
The gnat retires with verdant laurel
Now rings his trumpet clang As at the charge it rang
But while his triumph note he blows Straight on our valiant conqueror goes A spider ambuscade to meet And make its web his

THE ASS LOADED WITH SPONGES AND THE ASS LOADED WITH SALT

A man whom I shall call an His sceptre like some Roman emperor bearing Drove on two coursers of protracted ear The one with sponges laden briskly faring The other lifting legs As if he trod on eggs With constant need of goading And bags of salt for loading
hill and dale our merry pilgrims pass Till coming to a river ford at last They stopp quite puzzled on the shore
Our asseteer had cross the stream before So on the lighter beast astride He drives the other spite of dread Which loath indeed to go ahead Into a deep hole turns aside And facing right about Where he went in comes out For duckings two or three Had power the salt to melt So that the creature felt His burden shoulders free
The sponger like a sequent sheep Pursuing through the water deep Into the same hole plunges Himself his rider and the sponges
All three drank deeply asseteer and ass For boon companions of their load might pass Which last became so sore a weight The ass fell down Belike to drown His rider risking equal fate
A helper came no matter who
The moral needs no more ado That all ca act alike The point I wish to strike

THE LION AND THE RAT

To show to all your kindness it behoves There none so small but you his aid may need
I quote two fables for this weighty creed Which either of them fully proves
From underneath the sward A rat quite off his guard Popp out between a lion paws
The beast of royal bearing Show what a lion was The creature life by sparing A kindness well repaid For little as you would have thought His majesty would ever need his aid It proved full soon A precious boon
Forth issuing from his forest glen T explore the haunts of men In lion net his majesty was caught From which his strength and rage Served not to disengage
The rat ran up with grateful glee Gnaw off a rope and set him free

By time and toil we sever What strength and rage could never

THE DOVE AND THE ANT

The same instruction we may get From another couple smaller yet

A dove came to a brook to drink When leaning its crumbling brink An ant fell in and vainly tried In this to her an ocean tide To reach the land whereat the dove With every living thing in love Was prompt a spire of grass to throw her By which the ant regain the shore

A barefoot scamp both mean and sly Soon after chanced this dove to spy And being arm with bow and arrow The hungry codger doubted not The bird of Venus in his pot Would make a soup before the morrow
Just as his deadly bow he drew Our ant just bit his heel
Roused by the villain squeal The dove took timely hint and flew Far from the rascal coop And with her flew his soup

THE ASTROLOGER WHO STUMBLED INTO A WELL

To an astrologer who fell Plump to the bottom of a well blockhead
cried a see your feet and read the sky

This upshot of a story will suffice To give a useful hint to most For few there are in this our world so wise As not to trust in star or ghost Or cherish secretly the creed That men the book of destiny may read
This book by Homer and his pupils sung What is it in plain common sense But what was chance those ancient folks among And with ourselves God providence
Now chance doth bid defiance To every thing like science wrong if not To call it hazard fortune lot Things palpably uncertain
But from the purposes divine The deep of infinite design Who boasts to lift the curtain
Whom but himself doth God allow To read his bosom thoughts
and how Would he imprint upon the stars sublime The shrouded secrets of the night of time
And all for what
To exercise the wit Of those who on astrology have writ
To help us shun inevitable ills
To poison for us even pleasure rills
The choicest blessings to destroy Exhausting ere they come their joy
Such faith is worse than error is a crime
The moves and marks the course of time The sun sheds on our days The glory of his rays And all from this we can divine Is that they need to rise and shine To roll the seasons ripen fruits And cheer the hearts of men and brutes
How tallies this revolving universe With human things eternally diverse
Ye horoscopers waning quacks Please turn on Europe courts your backs And taking on your travelling lists The alchemists Budge off together to the land of mists
But I digress
Return we now bethinking Of our poor whom we left a drinking
Besides the folly of his lying trade This man the type may well be made Of those who at chimeras stare When they should mind the things that are

Aesop
Diogenes Laertius tells the story of this fable of Thales of Miletus
It is said that once he Thales was led out of his house by an old woman for the purpose of observing the stars and he fell into a ditch and bewailed himself
On which the old woman said to him you O Thales who can not see what is under your feet think that thou shalt understand what is in heaven

THE HARE AND THE FROGS

Once in his bed deep mused the hare What else but muse could he do there
And soon by gloom was much afflicted To gloom the creature much addicted

these constitutions nervous He cried wretchedly they serve us
We timid people by their action Ca eat nor sleep with satisfaction We ca enjoy a pleasure single But with some misery it must mingle
Myself for one am forced by cursed fear To sleep with open eye as well as ear
Correct yourself says some adviser
Grows fear by such advice the wiser
Indeed I well enough descry That men have fear as well as I
With such revolving thoughts our hare Kept watch in care
A passing shade or leaflet quiver Would give his blood a boiling fever
Full soon his melancholy soul Aroused from dreaming doze By noise too slight for foes He scuds in haste to reach his hole
He pass a pond and from its border bogs Plunge after plunge in leap the timid frogs
I do to them I see He cried others do to me
The sight of even me a hare Sufficeth some I find to scare
And here the terror of my tramp Hath put to rout it seems a camp
The trembling fools
they take me for The very thunderbolt of war
I see the coward never skulk a foe That might not scare a coward still below

Upon a tree there mounted guard A veteran cock adroit and cunning When to the roots a fox up running Spoke thus in tones of kind regard quarrel brother at an end Henceforth I hope to live your friend For peace now reigns Throughout the animal domains
I bear the news come down I pray And give me the embrace fraternal And please my brother do delay
So much the tidings do concern all That I must spread them far
Now you and yours can take your walks Without a fear or thought of hawks
And should you clash with them or others In us you find the best of brothers For which you may this joyful night Your merry bonfires light
But first let seal the bliss With one fraternal kiss
friend the cock replied my word A better thing I never heard And doubly I rejoice To hear it from your voice And really there must be something in it For yonder come two greyhounds which I flatter Myself are couriers on this very matter
They come so fast they be here in a minute
I down and all of us will seal the blessing With general kissing and caressing
said fox errand pressing I hurry on my way And we rejoice some other day
So off the fellow scamper quick and light To gain the of a neighbouring height Less happy in his stratagem than flight
The cock laugh sweetly in his sleeve is doubly sweet deceiver to deceive

THE RAVEN WISHING TO IMITATE THE EAGLE

The bird of Jove bore off a mutton A raven being witness
That weaker bird but equal glutton Not doubting of his fitness To do the same with ease And bent his taste to please Took round the flock his sweep And mark among the sheep The one of fairest flesh and size A real sheep of sacrifice A dainty titbit bestial Reserved for mouth celestial
Our gormand gloating round Cried I wonder much Who could have made you such
You far the fattest I have found I take you for my eating
And on the creature bleating He settled down
Now sooth to say This sheep would weigh More than a cheese And had a fleece Much like that matting famous Which graced the chin of Polyphemus So fast it clung to every claw It was not easy to withdraw
The shepherd came caught caged and to their joy Gave croaker to his children for a toy

Ill plays the pilferer the bigger thief One self one ought to know in brief Example is a dangerous lure Death strikes the gnat where flies the wasp secure

THE PEACOCK COMPLAINING TO JUNO

The peacock to the queen of heaven Complain in some such words goddess you have given To me the of birds A voice which fills by taste quite just All nature with disgust Whereas that little paltry thing The nightingale pours from her throat So sweet and ravishing a note She bears alone the honours of the spring

In anger Juno heard And cried on you jealous bird
Grudge you the nightingale her voice Who in the rainbow neck rejoice Than costliest silks more richly tinted In charms of grace and form unstinted Who strut in kingly pride Your glorious tail spread wide With brilliants which in sheen do Outshine the jeweller bow window
Is there a bird beneath the blue That has more charms than you
No animal in everything can shine
By just partition of our gifts divine Each has its full and proper share Among the birds that cleave the air The hawk a swift the eagle is a brave one For omens serves the hoarse old raven The rook of coming ills the prophet And if there any discontent I heard not of it

then your envious complaint Or I instead of making up your lack Will take your boasted plumage from your back

Phaedrus III

The peacock was consecrated to Juno the Queen of Heaven and was under her protection


THE CAT METAMORPHOSED INTO A WOMAN

A bachelor caress his cat A darling fair and delicate So deep in love he thought her mew The sweetest voice he ever knew
By prayers and tears and magic art The man got Fate to take his part And lo
one morning at his side His cat transform became his bride
In wedded state our man was seen The fool in courtship he had been
No lover was so bewitch By any maiden charms As was this husband so enrich By hers within his arms
He praised her beauties this and that And saw there nothing of the cat
In short by passion aid he Thought her a perfect lady

was night some mice Disturb the nuptial joys
Excited by the noise The bride sprang at them in a trice The mice were scared and fled
The bride scarce in her bed The gnawing heard and sprang again And this time not in vain For in this novel form array Of her the mice were less afraid
Through life she loved this mousing course So great is stubborn nature force

In mockery of change the old Will keep their youthful bent
When once the cloth has got its fold The its scent In vain your efforts and your care To make them other than they are
To work reform do what you will Old habit will be habit still
Nor fork nor strap can mend its manners Nor beat down its banners
Secure the doors against the renter And through the windows it will enter

THE LION AND THE ASS HUNTING

The king of animals with royal grace Would celebrate his birthday in the chase
was not with bow and arrows To slay some wretched sparrows The lion hunts the wild boar of the wood The antlered deer and stags the fat and good
This time the king t insure success Took for his an ass A creature of stentorian voice That felt much honour by the choice
The lion hid him in a proper station And order him to bray for his vocation Assured that his tempestuous cry The boldest beasts would terrify And cause them from their lairs to fly
And sooth the horrid noise the creature made Did strike the tenants of the wood with dread And as they headlong fled All fell within the lion ambuscade
not my service glorious Made both of us victorious
Cried out the ass
said the lion bray
Had I not known yourself and race I should have been myself afraid
If he had dared the donkey Had shown himself right spunky At this retort though justly made For who could suffer boasts to pass So to an ass

THE WILL EXPLAINED BY AESOP

If what old story says of Aesop true The oracle of Greece he was And more than Areopagus he knew With all its wisdom in the laws
The following tale gives but a sample Of what has made his fame so ample
Three daughters shared a father purse Of habits totally diverse
The first bewitched with drinks delicious The next coquettish and capricious The third supremely avaricious
The sire expectant of his fate Bequeathed his whole estate In equal shares to them And to their mother just the same To her then payable and not before Each daughter should possess her part no more
The father died
The females three Were much in haste the will to see
They read and read but still Saw not the willer will
For could it well be understood That each of this sweet sisterhood When she possess her part no more Should to her mother pay it
was surely not so easy saying How lack of means would help the paying
What meant their honour father then
Th affair was brought to legal men Who after turning the case Some hundred thousand different ways Threw down the learned bonnet Unable to decide upon it And then advised the heirs Without more thought t adjust affairs
As to the widow share the counsel say hold it just the daughters each should pay One third to her upon demand Should she not choose to have it stand Commuted as a life annuity Paid from her husband death with due congruity
The thing thus order the estate Is duly cut in portions three
And in the first they all agree To put the plate Luxurious cooling mugs Enormous liquor jugs Rich cupboards built beneath the trellised vine The stores of ancient sweet Malvoisian wine The slaves to serve it at a sign In short whatever in a great house There is of feasting apparatus
The second part is made Of what might help the jilting trade The city house and furniture Exquisite and genteel be sure The eunuchs milliners and laces The jewels shawls and costly dresses
The third is made of household stuff More vulgar rude and rough Farms fences flocks and fodder And men and beasts to turn the sod
This done since it was thought To give the parts by lot Might suit or it might not Each paid her share of fees dear And took the part that pleased her
was in great Athens town Such judgment gave the gown
And there the public voice Applauded both the judgment and the choice
But Aesop well was satisfied The learned men had set aside In judging thus the testament The very gist of its intent
dead quoth he he but know of it Would heap reproaches on such Attic wit
What
men who proudly take their place As sages of the human race Lack they the simple skill To settle such a will
This said he undertook himself The task of portioning the pelf And straightway gave each maid the part The least according to her heart The prim coquette the drinking stuff The drinker then the farms and cattle And on the miser rude and rough The robes and lace did Aesop settle For thus he said early date Would see the sisters alienate Their several shares of the estate
No motive now in maidenhood to tarry They all would seek post haste to marry And having each a splendid bait Each soon would find a mate And leaving thus their father goods intact Would to their mother pay them all in fact Which of the testament Was plainly the intent
The people who had thought a slave an ass Much wonder how it came to pass That one alone should have more sense Than all their men of most pretence

Phaedrus IV

This was the Athenian Court of Justice at Mars Hill
It is said to have been called the Hill of Mars because according to tradition the first trial there was that of Mars for the murder of Halirrhotius

THE MILLER HIS SON AND THE ASS
To De Maucroix

Because the arts are plainly birthright matters For fables we to ancient Greece are debtors But still this field could not be reap so clean As not to let us later comers glean
The hath deserts yet to dare And daily authors make discoveries there
I fain repeat one which our man of song Old Malherbe told one day to young Racan
Of Horace they the rivals and the heirs Apollo pets my masters I should say Sole by themselves were met I told one day Confiding each to each their thoughts and cares
Racan begins end my inward strife For well you know my friend what what in life Who through its varied course from stage to stage Have stored the full experience of age What shall I do
is time I chose profession
You know my fortune birth and disposition
Ought I to make the country my resort Or seek the army or to rise at court
There nought but mixeth bitterness with charms War hath its pleasures hymen its alarms
nothing hard to take my natural bent But I a world of people to content
a world
old Malherbe cries can sir
Why let me tell a story ere I answer

miller and his son I somewhere read The first in years the other but a lad A fine smart boy however I should say To sell their ass went to a fair one day
In order there to get the highest price They needs must keep their donkey fresh and nice So tying fast his feet they swung him clear And bore him hanging like a chandelier
Alas
poor country fellows
The first that sees their load loud laughing bellows What farce is this to split good people sides
The most an ass is not the one that rides
The miller much enlighten by this talk Untied his precious beast and made him walk
The ass who liked the other mode of travel Bray some complaint at trudging on the gravel Whereat not understanding well the beast The miller caused his hopeful son to ride And walk behind without a spark of pride
Three merchants pass and mightily displeased The eldest of these gentlemen cried out Ho there
dismount for shame you lubber lout
Nor make a of your sire Change places as the rights of age require
To please you sirs the miller said I ought
So down the young and up the old man got
Three girls next passing What a shame
says one That boy should be obliged on foot to run While that old chap upon his ass astride Should play the calf and like a bishop ride
Please save your wit the miller made reply Tough veal my girls the calf as old as I
But joke on joke repeated changed his mind So up he took at last his son behind
Not thirty yards ahead another set Found fault
The biggest fools I ever met Says one of them such burdens to impose
The ass is faint and dying with their blows
Is this indeed the mercy which these rustics Show to their honest faithful old domestics
If to the fair these lazy fellows ride be to sell thereat the donkey hide
Zounds
cried the miller precious little brains Hath he who takes to please the world such pains But since we in we try what can be done
So off the ass they jump himself and son And like a prelate donkey march alone
Another man they met
These folks said he Enslave themselves to let their ass go free The darling brute
If I might be so bold I counsel them to have him set in gold
Not so went Nicholas his Jane to woo Who rode we sing his ass to save his shoe
Ass
ass
our man replied we asses three
I do avow myself an ass to be But since my sage advisers ca agree Their words henceforth shall not be heeded I suit myself
And he succeeded

you choose army love or court In town or country make resort Take wife or cowl ride you or walk Doubt not but tongues will have their talk

THE MEMBERS AND THE BELLY

Perhaps had I but shown due loyalty This book would have begun with royalty Of which in certain points of view Boss Belly is the image true In whose bereavements all the members share Of whom the latter once so weary were As all due service to forbear On what they called his idle plan Resolved to play the gentleman And let his lordship live on air
said they sweat from day to day And all for whom and what
Ourselves we profit not
Our labour has no object but one That is to feed this lazy glutton
We learn the resting trade By his example aid
So said so done all labour ceased The hands refused to grasp the arms to strike All other members did the like
Their boss might labour if he pleased
It was an error which they soon repented With pain of languid poverty acquainted
The heart no more the blood renew And hence repair no more accrued To strength Whereby the mutineers at length Saw that the idle belly in its way Did more for common benefit than they

For royalty our fable makes A thing that gives as well as takes Its power all labour to sustain Nor for themselves turns out their labour vain
It gives the artist bread the merchant riches Maintains the diggers in their ditches Pays man of war and magistrate Supports the swarms in place That live on sovereign grace In short is caterer for the state

Menenius told the story well When Rome of old in pieces fell The commons parting from the senate
ills said they we complain at Are that the honours treasures power and dignity Belong to them alone while we Get nought our labour for But tributes taxes and fatigues of war
Without the walls the people had their stand Prepared to march in search of other land When by this noted fable Menenius was able To draw them hungry home To duty and to Rome

THE WOLF TURNED SHEPHERD

A wolf whose gettings from the flocks Began to be but few Bethought himself to play the fox In character quite new
A shepherd hat and coat he took A cudgel for a crook Nor the pipe forgot And more to seem what he was not Himself upon his hat he wrote Willie shepherd of these sheep
His person thus complete His crook in upraised feet The impostor Willie stole upon the keep
The real Willie on the grass asleep Slept there indeed profoundly His dog and pipe slept also soundly His drowsy sheep around lay
As for the greatest number Much bless the hypocrite their slumber And hoped to drive away the flock Could he the shepherd voice but mock
He thought undoubtedly he could
He tried the tone in which he spoke Loud echoing from the wood The plot and slumber broke Sheep dog and man awoke
The wolf in sorry plight In hampering coat bedight Could neither run nor fight

There always leakage of deceit Which makes it never safe to cheat
Whoever is a wolf had better Keep clear of hypocritic fetter

The story of this fable is traced to Verdizotti an Italian poet who lived about

THE FROGS ASKING A KING

A certain commonwealth aquatic Grown tired of order democratic By clamouring in the ears of Jove effected Its being to a monarch power subjected
Jove flung it down at first a king pacific
Who nathless fell with such a splash terrific The marshy folks a foolish race and timid Made breathless haste to get from him hid
They dived into the mud beneath the water Or found among the reeds and rushes quarter
And long it was they dared not see The dreadful face of majesty Supposing that some monstrous frog Had been sent down to rule the bog
The king was really a log Whose gravity inspired with awe The first that from his Forth venturing astonish saw The royal blockhead face
With trembling and with fear At last he drew quite near
Another follow and another yet Till quite a crowd at last were met Who growing fast and strangely bolder Perch soon upon the royal shoulder
His gracious majesty kept still And let his people work their will
Clack clack
what din beset the ears of Jove
want a king the people said move
The god straight sent them down a crane Who caught and slew them without measure And gulp their carcasses at pleasure Whereat the frogs more wofully complain

what
great Jupiter replied your desires must I be tied
Think you such government is bad
You should have kept what first you had Which having blindly fail to do It had been prudent still for you To let that former king suffice More meek and mild if not so wise
With this now make yourselves content Lest for your sins a worse be sent

THE FOX AND THE GOAT

A fox once journey and for company A certain bearded horned goat had he Which goat no further than his nose could see
The fox was deeply versed in trickery
These travellers did thirst compel To seek the bottom of a well
There having drunk enough for two Says fox friend what shall we do
is time that we were thinking Of something else than drinking
Raise you your feet upon the wall And stick your horns up straight and tall Then up your back I climb with ease And draw you after if you please
by my beard the other said just the thing
I like a head Well stock with sense like thine
Had it been left to mine I do confess I never should have thought of this
So Renard clamber out And leaving there the goat Discharged his obligations By preaching thus on patience Heaven put sense thy head within To match the beard upon thy chin Thou wouldst have thought a bit Before descending such a pit
I out of it good bye With prudent effort try Yourself to extricate
For me affairs of state Permit me not to wait

Whatever way you wend Consider well the end

THE EAGLE THE WILD SOW AND THE CAT

A certain hollow tree Was tenanted by three
An eagle held a lofty bough The hollow root a wild wood sow A female cat between the two
All busy with maternal labours They lived awhile obliging neighbours
At last the cat deceitful tongue Broke up the peace of old and young
Up climbing to the eagle nest She said with whisker lips compress death or what as much we mothers fear That of our helpless offspring dear Is surely drawing near
Beneath our feet see you not how Destruction plotted by the sow
Her constant digging soon or late Our proud old castle will uproot
And then O sad and shocking fate She eat our young ones as the fruit
Were there but hope of saving one soothe somewhat my bitter moan
Thus leaving apprehensions hideous Down went the puss perfidious To where the sow no longer digging Was in the very act of pigging
friend and neighbour whisper she warn you on your guard to be
Your pigs should you but leave a minute This eagle here will seize them in it
Speak not of this I beg at all Lest on my head her wrath should fall
Another breast with fear inspired With fiendish joy the cat retired
The eagle ventured no egress To feed her young the sow still less
Fools they to think that any curse Than ghastly famine could be worse
Both staid at home resolved and obstinate To save their young ones from impending fate The royal bird for fear of mine For fear of royal claws the swine
All died at length with hunger The older and the younger There staid of eagle race or boar Not one this side of death dread door A sad misfortune which The wicked cats made rich
O what is there of hellish plot The treacherous tongue dares not
Of all the ills Pandora box outpour Deceit I think is most to be abhorr

THE DRUNKARD AND HIS WIFE

Each has his fault to which he clings In spite of shame or fear
This apophthegm a story brings To make its truth more clear
A sot had lost health mind and purse And truly for that matter Sots mostly lose the latter Ere running half their course
When wine one day of wit had fill the room His wife inclosed him in a spacious tomb
There did the fumes evaporate At leisure from his drowsy pate
When he awoke he found His body wrapp around With chill and damp Beneath a dim sepulchral lamp
this
My wife a widow sad
He cried I a ghost
Dead
dead
Thereat his spouse with snaky hair And robes like those the Furies wear With voice to fit the realms below Brought boiling caudle to his bier For Lucifer the proper cheer By which her husband came to know For he had heard of those three ladies Himself a citizen of Hades
may your office be

server up of Pluto meat And bring his guests the same to eat

THE GOUT AND THE SPIDER

When Nature angrily turn out Those plagues the spider and the gout you said she huts so meanly built These palaces so grand and richly gilt
By mutual agreement fix Your choice of dwellings or if not To end th affair by lot Draw out these little sticks
huts are not for me the spider cried not for me the palace cried the gout For there a sort of men she spied Call doctors going in and out From whom she could not hope for ease
So hied her to the huts the fell disease And fastening on a poor man toe Hoped there to fatten on his woe And torture him fit after fit Without a summons to quit From old Hippocrates
The spider on the lofty ceiling As if she had a feeling
Wove wide her cunning toils Soon rich with insect spoils
A maid destroy them as she swept the room Repair again they felt the fatal broom
The wretched creature every day From house and home must pack away
At last her courage giving out She went to seek her sister gout And in the field descried her Quite starved more evils did betide her Than befel the poorest spider Her toiling host enslaved her so And made her chop and dig and hoe
Says one Kept brisk and busy The gout is made half easy
when exclaim the sad disease this my misery stop
O sister spider if you please Our places let us swop
The spider gladly heard And took her at her word And flourish in the Not forced the tidy broom to dodge The gout selecting her abode With an ecclesiastic judge Turn judge herself and by her code He from his couch no more could budge
The salves and cataplasms Heaven knows That mock the misery of his toes While aye without a blush the curse Kept driving onward worse and worse
Needless to say the sisterhood Thought their exchange both wise and good

THE WOLF AND THE STORK

The wolves are prone to play the glutton
One at a certain feast is said So stuff himself with lamb and mutton He seem but little short of dead
Deep in his throat a bone stuck fast
Well for this wolf who could not speak That soon a stork quite near him pass
By signs invited with her beak The bone she drew With slight ado And for this skilful surgery Demanded modestly her fee

Go for a wretch ingrate Nor tempt again your fate

THE SWAN AND THE COOK

The pleasures of a poultry yard Were by a swan and gosling shared
The swan was kept there for his looks The thrifty gosling for the cooks The first the garden pride the latter A greater favourite on the platter
They swam the ditches side by side And oft in sports aquatic vied Plunging splashing far and wide With rivalry satisfied
One day the cook named Thirsty John Sent for the gosling took the swan In haste his throat to cut And put him in the pot
The bird complaint resounded In glorious melody Whereat the cook astounded His sad mistake to see Cried
make soup of a musician
Please God I never set such dish on
No no I never cut a throat That sings so sweet a note

is thus whatever peril may alarm us Sweet words will never harm us

THE WOLVES AND THE SHEEP

a thousand years of war The wearers of the fleece And wolves at last made peace Which both appear the better for For if the wolves had now and then Eat up a straggling ewe or wether As often had the shepherd men Turn into leather
Fear always spoil the verdant herbage And so it did the bloody carnage
Hence peace was sweet and lest it should be riven On both sides hostages were given
The sheep as by the terms arranged For pups of wolves their dogs exchanged Which being done above suspicion Confirm and seal by high commission What time the pups were fully grown And felt an appetite for prey And saw the sheepfold left alone The shepherds all away They seized the fattest lambs they could And choking dragg them to the wood Of which by secret means apprised Their sires as is surmised Fell on the hostage guardians of the sheep And slew them all asleep
So quick the deed of perfidy was done There fled to tell the tale not one

From which we may conclude That peace with villains will be rued
Peace in itself is true May be a good for you But is an evil nathless When enemies are faithless

THE LION GROWN OLD

A lion mourning in his age the wane Of might once dreaded through his wild domain Was mock at last upon his throne By subjects of his own Strong through his weakness grown
The horse his head saluted with a kick The wolf snapp at his royal hide The ox too gored him in the side The unhappy lion sad and sick Could hardly growl he was so weak
In uncomplaining stoic pride He waited for the hour of fate Until the ass approach his gate Whereat is too much he saith willingly would yield my breath But ah
thy kick is double death

Pray will you never quit this dull retreat

sweet
cried Progne to waste Such tones on beasts devoid of taste Or on some rustic at the most
Should you by deserts be engross
Come be the city pride and boast
Besides the woods remind of harms That Tereus in them did your charms

THE WOMAN DROWNED

I hate that saying old and savage is nothing but a woman drowning
That much I say
What grief more keen should have edge Than loss of her of all our joys the crowning
Thus much suggests the fable I am borrowing
A woman perish in the water Where anxiously and sorrowing Her husband sought her To ease the grief he could not cure By honour rites of sepulture
It chanced that near the fatal spot Along the stream which had Produced a death so sad There walk some men that knew it not
The husband ask if they had seen His wife or aught that hers had been
One promptly answer
But search the stream below It must nave borne her in its flow
said another above
In that direction She would have floated by the love Of contradiction
This joke was truly out of season I do propose to weigh its reason
But whether such propensity The sex fault may be Or not one thing is very sure Its own propensities endure
Up to the end they have their will And if it could be further still

THE WEASEL IN THE GRANARY

A weasel through a hole contrived to squeeze She was recovering from disease Which led her to a farmer hoard
There lodged her wasted form she cherish Heaven knows the lard and victuals stored That by her gnawing perish
Of which the consequence Was sudden corpulence
A week or so was past When having fully broken fast
A noise she heard and hurried To find the hole by which she came And seem to find it not the same So round she ran most sadly flurried And coming back thrust out her head Which sticking there she said is the hole there ca be blunder What makes it now so small I wonder Where but the other day I pass with ease
A rat her trouble sees And cries with an emptier belly You enter lean and lean must sally
What I have said to you Has eke been said to not a few Who in a vast variety of cases Have ventured into places

Aesop also in Horace Book I

THE CAT AND THE OLD RAT

A of our sort Historifies in short Of one that may be reckon A Rodilard the Second The Alexander of the cats The Attila the scourge of rats Whose fierce and whisker head Among the latter spread A league around its dread Who seem indeed determined The world should be unvermined
The planks with props more false than slim The tempting heaps of poison meal The traps of wire and traps of steel Were only play compared with him
At length so sadly were they scared
The rats and mice no longer dared To show their thievish faces Outside their Thus shunning all pursuit whereat Our crafty General Cat Contrived to hang himself as dead Beside the wall with downward head Resisting gravitation laws By clinging with his hinder claws To some small bit of string
The rats esteem the thing A judgment for some naughty deed Some thievish snatch Or ugly scratch And thought their foe had got his meed By being hung indeed
With hope elated all Of laughing at his funeral They thrust their noses out in air And now to show their heads they dare Now dodging back now venturing more At last upon the larder store They fall to filching as of yore
A scanty feast enjoy these shallows Down dropp the hung one from his gallows And of the hindmost caught
other tricks to me are known Said he while tearing bone from bone long experience taught The point is settled free from doubt That from your holes you shall come out
His threat as good as prophecy Was proved by Mildandsly For putting on a mealy robe He squatted in an open tub And held his purring and his breath Out came the vermin to their death
On this occasion one old stager A rat as grey as any badger Who had in battle lost his tail Abstained from smelling at the meal And cried far off
General Cat I much suspect a heap like that Your meal is not the thing perhaps For one who knows somewhat of traps Should you a sack of meal become I let you be and stay at home

Well said I think and prudently By one who knew distrust to be The parent of security

THE LION IN LOVE

To Mademoiselle De Sévigné

Sévigné type of every grace In female form and face In your regardlessness of men Can you show favour when The sportive fable craves your ear And see unmoved by fear A lion haughty heart Thrust through by Love audacious dart
Strange conqueror Love
And happy he And strangely privileged and free Who only knows by story Him and his feats of glory
If on this subject you are wont To think the simple truth too blunt The fabulous may less affront Which now inspired with gratitude Yea kindled into zeal most fervent Doth venture to intrude Within your maiden solitude And kneel your humble In times when animals were speakers Among the quadrupedal seekers Of our alliance There came the lions
And wherefore not
for then They yielded not to men In point of courage or of sense Nor were in looks without pretence
A lion on his way Across a meadow met one day A shepherdess who charm him so That as such matters ought to go He sought the maiden for his bride
Her sire it can not be denied Had much preferr a Of less terrific mouth and paw
It was not easy to decide The lion might the gift abuse was not quite prudent to refuse
And if refusal there should be Perhaps a marriage one would see Some morning made clandestinely
For over and above The fact that she could bear With none but males of martial air The lady was in love With him of shaggy hair
Her sire much wanting cover To send away the lover Thus spoke daughter sir Is delicate
I fear to her Your fond caressings Will prove rough blessings
To banish all alarm About such sort of harm Permit us to remove the cause By filing off your teeth and claws
In such a case your royal kiss Will be to her a safer bliss And to yourself a sweeter Since she will more respond To those endearments fond With which you greet her
The lion gave consent at once By love so great a dunce
Without a tooth or claw now view him A fort with cannon spiked
The dogs let loose upon him slew him All biting safely where they liked

O tyrant Love
when held by you We may to prudence bid adieu

THE SHEPHERD AND THE SEA

A shepherd neighbour to the sea Lived with his flock contentedly
His fortune though but small Was safe within his call
At last some stranded kegs of gold Him tempted and his flock he sold Turn merchant and the ocean waves Bore all his treasure to its caves
Brought back to keeping sheep once more But not chief shepherd as before When sheep were his that grazed the shore He who as Corydon or Thyrsis Might once have shone in pastoral verses Bedeck with rhyme and metre Was nothing now but Peter
But time and toil redeem in full Those harmless creatures rich in wool And as the lulling winds one day The vessels wafted with a gentle motion you he cried money Madam Ocean
Address yourself to some one else I pray You shall not get it out of me
I know too well your treachery

This tale no fiction but a fact Which by experience back Proves that a single penny At present held and certain Is worth five times as many Of Hope beyond the curtain That one should be content with his condition And shut his ears to counsels of ambition More faithless than the sea and which Doth thousands beggar where it makes one rich Inspires the hope of wealth in glorious forms And blasts the same with piracy and storms

THE FLY AND THE ANT

A fly and ant upon a sunny bank Discuss the question of their rank
Jupiter
the former said love of self so turn the head That one so mean and crawling And of so low a calling To boast equality shall dare With me the daughter of the air
In palaces I am a guest And even at thy glorious feast
the people that adore thee May immolate for thee a bullock I sure to taste the meat before thee
Meanwhile this starveling in her hillock Is living on some bit of straw Which she has labour home to draw
But tell me now my little thing Do you camp ever on a king An emperor or lady
I do and have full many a On fairest bosom of the fair And sport myself upon her hair
Come now my hearty rack your brain To make a case about your grain
have you done
replied the ant
enter palaces I grant And for it get right soundly cursed
Of sacrifices rich and fat Your taste quite likely is the first Are they the better off for that
You enter with the holy train So enters many a wretch profane
On heads of kings and asses you may squat Deny your vaunting I will not But well such impudence I know Provokes a sometimes fatal blow
The name in which your vanity delights Is own as well by parasites And spies that die by ropes as you soon will By famine or by When Phoebus goes to cheer The other hemisphere The very time to me most dear
Not forced abroad to go Through wind and rain and snow My summer work I then enjoy And happily my mind employ From care by care exempted
By which this truth I leave to you That by two sorts of glory we are tempted The false one and the true
Work waits time flies adieu This gabble does not fill My granary or till

THE GARDENER AND HIS LORD

A lover of gardens half cit and half clown Possess a nice garden beside a small town And with it a field by a live hedge inclosed Where sorrel and lettuce at random disposed A little of jasmine and much of wild thyme Grew gaily and all in their prime To make up Miss Peggy bouquet The grace of her bright wedding day
For poaching in such a nice field was a shame A foraging hare was to blame
Whereof the good owner bore down This tale to the lord of the town mischievous animal morning and night In spite of my caution comes in for his bite
He laughs at my and snares For clubbing and stoning as little he cares
I think him a wizard
A wizard
the coot
I catch him if he were a devil to boot
The lord said in haste to have sport for his hounds clear him I warrant you out of your grounds To morrow I do it without any fail

The thing thus agreed on all hearty and hale The lord and his party at crack of the dawn With hounds at their heels canter over the lawn
Arrived said the lord in his jovial mood breakfast with you if your chickens are good
That lass my good man I suppose is your daughter No news of a
Any one sought her
No doubt by the score
Keep an eye on the docket Eh
Dost understand me
I speak of the pocket
So saying the daughter he graciously greeted And close by his lordship he bade her be seated Avow himself pleased with so handsome a maid And then with her kerchief familiarly play Impertinent freedoms the virtuous fair Repell with a modest and air So much that her father a little suspected The girl had already a lover elected
Meanwhile in the kitchen what bustling and cooking
what are your hams
They are very good looking
kept for your lordship
take them said he elegant flitches are welcome to me
He breakfasted finely his troop with delight Dogs horses and grooms of the best appetite
Thus he govern his host in the shape of a guest Unbottled his wine and his daughter caress
To breakfast the huddle of hunters succeeds The yelping of dogs and the neighing of steeds All cheering and fixing for wonderful deeds The horns and the bugles make thundering din Much wonders our gardener what it can mean
The worst is his garden most wofully fares Adieu to its arbours and borders and squares Adieu to its chiccory onions and leeks Adieu to whatever good cookery seeks

Beneath a great cabbage the hare was in bed Was started and shot at and hastily fled
Off went the wild chase with a terrible screech And not through a hole but a horrible breach Which some one had made at the beck of the lord Wide through the poor hedge
have been quite absurd Should lordship not freely from garden go out On horseback attended by rabble and rout
Scarce suffer the his patience to wince Consoling himself was the sport of a prince While bipeds and quadrupeds served to devour And trample and waste in the space of an hour Far more than a nation of foraging hares Could possibly do in a hundred of years

Small princes this story is true When told in relation to you
In settling your quarrels with kings for your tools You prove yourselves losers and eminent fools


THE ASS AND THE LITTLE DOG

One native talent from its course Can not be turned aside by force But poorly apes the country clown The polish manners of the town
Their Maker chooses but a few With power of pleasing to imbue Where wisely leave it we the mass Unlike a certain fabled ass That thought to gain his master blessing By jumping on him and caressing

said the donkey in his heart it to be that puppy part To lead his useless life In full companionship With master and his wife While I must bear the whip
What doth the cur a kiss to draw
Forsooth he only gives his paw
If that is all there needs to please I do the thing myself with ease
Possess with this bright notion His master sitting on his chair At leisure in the open air He ambled up with awkward motion And put his talents to the proof Upraised his bruised and batter hoof And with an amiable mien His master patted on the chin The action gracing with a word The fondest bray that was heard
O such caressing was there ever
Or melody with such a quaver

Martin
here
a club a club bring
Out cried the master sore offended
So Martin gave the ass a drubbing And so the comedy was ended

La Fontaine has a name for a groom or ostler armed with his cudgel of office taken from Rabelais


THE BATTLE OF THE RATS AND THE WEASELS

The weasels live no more than cats On terms of friendship with the rats And were it not that these Through doors contrive to squeeze Too narrow for their foes The animals Would long ago have routed And from the planet scouted Their race as I suppose

One year it did betide When they were multiplied An army took the field Of rats with spear and shield Whose crowded ranks led on A king named Ratapon
The weasels too their banner Unfurl in warlike manner
As Fame her trumpet sounds The victory balanced well Enrich were fallow grounds Where slaughter legions fell But by said trollop tattle The loss of life in battle Thinn most the rattish race In almost every place And finally their rout Was total spite of stout Artarpax and Psicarpax And valiant Meridarpax Who cover with dust Long time sustain their host Down sinking on the plain
Their efforts were in vain Fate ruled that final hour Inexorable power
And so the captains fled As well as those they led The princes perish all
The undistinguish small In certain holes found shelter In crowding But the nobility Could not go in so free Who proudly had assumed Each one a helmet plumed We know not truly whether For honour sake the feather Or foes to strike with terror But truly was their error
Nor hole nor crack nor crevice Will let their in While meaner rats in bevies An easy passage win So that the shafts of fate Do chiefly hit the great

A feather in the cap Is oft a great mishap
An equipage too grand Comes often to a stand Within a narrow place
The small the case With ease slip through a strait Where larger folks must wait

THE MONKEY AND THE DOLPHIN

It was the custom of the Greeks For passengers sea to carry Both monkeys full of tricks And funny dogs to make them merry
A ship that had such things on deck Not far from Athens went to wreck
But for the dolphins all had drown
They are a philanthropic fish Which fact in Pliny may be found A better voucher who could wish
They did their best on this occasion
A monkey even on their plan Well nigh attain his own salvation A dolphin took him for a man And on his dorsal gave him place
So grave the silly creature face That one might well have set him down That old musician of renown
The fish had almost reach the land When as it happen what a pity He ask you from Athens grand
well they know me in that city
If ever you have business there I help you do it for my kin The highest offices are in
My cousin sir is now lord mayor
The dolphin thank him with good grace Both for himself and all his race And ask doubtless know Piraeus Where should we come to town you see us

yes indeed I know He was my crony long ago
The dunce knew not the harbour name And for a man mistook the same
The people are by no means few Who never went ten miles from home Nor know their from Rome Yet cackle just as if they knew
The dolphin laugh and then began His rider form and face to scan And found himself about to save From fishy feasts beneath the wave A mere resemblance of a man
So plunging down he turn to find Some drowning wight of human kind

It was then found that the music had attracted a number of dolphins round the ship and one of these took the bard on its back and conveyed him safely to Taenarus


THE MAN AND THE WOODEN GOD

A pagan kept a god of wood A sort that never hears Though furnish well with ears From which he hoped for wondrous good
The idol cost the board of three So much enrich was he With vows and offerings vain With bullocks garlanded and slain No idol ever had as that A kitchen quite so full and fat
But all this worship at his shrine Brought not from this same block divine Inheritance or hidden mine Or luck at play or any favour
Nay more if any storm whatever Brew trouble here or there The man was sure to have his share And suffer in his purse Although the god fared none the worse
At last by sheer impatience bold The man a crowbar seizes His idol breaks in pieces And finds it richly stuff with gold
this
Have I devoutly treated Says he godship to be cheated
Now leave my house and go your way And search for altars where you may
You like those natures dull and gross From which comes nothing but by blows The more I gave the less I got I now be rich and you may rot

THE JAY IN THE FEATHERS OF THE PEACOCK

A peacock moulted soon a jay was seen Bedeck with Argus tail of gold and green High strutting with elated crest As much a peacock as the rest
His trick was recognized and bruited His person jeer at hiss and hooted
The peacock gentry flock together And pluck the fool of every feather
Nay more when back he sneak to join his race They shut their portals in his face

There is another sort of jay The number of its legs the same Which makes of borrow plumes display And plagiary is its name
But hush
the tribe I not offend is not my work their ways to mend

Aesop Phaedrus I

tail of gold and According to mythology Argus surnamed Panoptes or possessed a hundred eyes some of which were never closed in sleep
At his death Juno either transformed him into the peacock or transferred his hundred eyes to the tail of that her favourite bird
Argus tail of gold and green therefore means tail endowed with the eyes of Argus


THE CAMEL AND THE FLOATING STICKS

The first who saw the humpback camel Fled off for life the next approach with care The third with tyrant rope did boldly dare The desert wanderer to trammel
Such is the power of use to change The face of objects new and strange Which grow by looking at so tame They do not even seem the same
And since this theme is up for our attention A certain watchman I will mention Who seeing something far Away upon the ocean Could not but speak his notion That was a ship of war
Some minutes more had past A was without a sail And then a boat and then a bale And floating sticks of wood at last

Full many things on earth I wot Will claim this tale and well they may They something dreadful far away But near at hand they not

THE FROG AND THE RAT

They to bamboozle are inclined Saith Merlin who bamboozled are
The word though rather unrefined Has yet an energy we ill can spare So by its aid I introduce my tale
A rat rotund and hale Not knowing either Fast or Lent Disporting round a went
A frog approach and with a friendly greeting Invited him to see her at her home And pledged a dinner worth his eating To which the rat was nothing loath to come
Of words persuasive there was little need She spoke however of a grateful bath Of sports and curious wonders on their path Of rarities of flower and rush and reed One day he would recount with glee To his assembled progeny The various beauties of these places The customs of the various races And laws that sway the realms aquatic She did not mean the hydrostatic
One thing alone the rat perplex He was but moderate as a swimmer
The frog this matter nicely fix By kindly lending him her Long paw which with a rush she tied To his and off they started side by side
Arrived upon the lakelet brink There was but little time to think
The frog leap in and almost brought her Bound guest to land beneath the water
Perfidious breach of law and right
She meant to have a supper warm Out of his sleek and dainty form
Already did her appetite Dwell on the morsel with delight
The gods in anguish he invokes His faithless hostess rudely mocks He struggles up she struggles down
A kite that hovers in the air Inspecting everything with care Now spies the rat belike to drown And with a rapid wing Upbears the wretched thing The frog too dangling by the string
The joy of such a double haul Was to the hungry kite not small
It gave him all that he could wish A double meal of flesh and fish

The best contrived deceit Can hurt its own contriver And perfidy doth often cheat Its author purse of every stiver

This is Merlin the wizard of the old French novels


THE ANIMALS SENDING TRIBUTE TO ALEXANDER

A fable flourished with antiquity Whose meaning I could never clearly see
Kind reader draw the moral if you able I give you here the naked fable
Fame having bruited that a great commander A son of Jove a certain Alexander Resolved to leave nought free on this our ball Had to his footstool gravely summon all Men quadrupeds and nullipeds together With all the every feather The goddess of the hundred mouths I say Thus having spread dismay By widely publishing abroad This mandate of the demigod The animals and all that do obey Their appetite alone mistrusted now That to another sceptre they must bow
Far in the desert met their various races All gathering from their
Discuss was many a notion
At last it was resolved on motion To pacify the conquering banner By sending homage in and tribute
With both the homage and its manner They charged the monkey as a glib brute And lest the chap should too much chatter In black on white they wrote the matter
Nought but the tribute served to fash As that must needs be paid in cash
A prince who chanced a mine to own At last obliged them with a loan
The mule and ass to bear the treasure Their service tender full of pleasure And then the caravan was none the worse Assisted by the camel and the horse
Forthwith proceeded all the four Behind the new ambassador And saw erelong within a narrow place Monseigneur Lion quite unwelcome face
met and all in time said he your fellow traveller will be
I wend my tribute by itself to bear And though is light I well might spare The unaccustom load
Take each a quarter if you please And I will guard you on the road More free and at my ease In better plight you understand To fight with any robber band
A lion to refuse the fact is Is not a very usual practice So in he comes for better and for worse Whatever he demands is done And spite of Jove heroic son He fattens freely from the public purse
While wending on their way They found a spot one day With waters hemm of crystal sheen Its carpet green Where pastured at their ease Both flocks of sheep and dainty heifers And play the cooling breeze The native land of all the zephyrs
No sooner is the lion there Than of some sickness he complains
Says he on your mission fare
A fever with its thirst and pains Dries up my blood and bakes my brains And I must search some herb Its fatal power to curb
For you there is no time to waste Pay me my money and make haste
The treasures were unbound And placed upon the ground
Then with a look which testified His royal joy the lion cried coins good heavens have multiplied
And see the young ones of the gold As big already as the old
The increase belongs to me no doubt And eagerly he took it out
was little staid beneath the lid The wonder was that any did
Confounded were the monkey and his suite
And dumb with fear betook them to their way And bore complaint to Jove great son they say Complaint without a reason meet For what could he
Though a celestial scion He could but fight as lion versus lion

When corsairs battle Turk with Turk They not about their proper work

The story of this fable has been traced to Gilbert Cousin in whose works it figures with the title De Jovis Ammonis oraculo

THE HORSE WISHING TO BE REVENGED UPON THE STAG

The horses have not always been The humble slaves of men
When in the past The fare of gentlemen was mast And even hats were never felt Horse ass and mule in forests dwelt
Nor saw one then as in these ages So many saddles housings pillions Such splendid equipages With postilions Such harnesses for cattle To be consumed in battle As one saw not so many feasts And people married by the priests
The horse fell out within that space With the antler stag so fleetly made He could not catch him in a race And so he came to man for aid
Man first his suppliant bitted Then on his back well seated Gave chase with spear and rested not Till to the ground the foe he brought
This done the honest horse quite blindly Thus thank his benefactor kindly sir I much obliged to you I back to savage life
Adieu
no the man replied better here abide I know too well your use
Here free from all abuse Remain a liege to me And large your provender shall be
Alas
good housing or good cheer That costs one liberty is dear
The horse his folly now perceived But quite too late he grieved
No grief his fate could alter His stall was built and there he lived And died there in his halter
Ah
wise had he one small offence forgot
Revenge however sweet is dearly bought By that one good which gone all else is nought

THE FOX AND THE BUST

The great are like the maskers of the stage Their show deceives the simple of the age
For all that they appear to be they pass With only those whose type the ass
The fox more wary looks beneath the skin And looks on every side and when he sees That all their glory is a semblance thin He turns and saves the hinges of his knees With such a speech as once is said He utter to a hero head
A bust somewhat colossal in its size Attracted crowds of wondering eyes
The fox admired the sculptor pains head said he void of brains
The same remark to many a lord applies

THE WOLF THE GOAT AND THE KID

As went the goat her pendent dugs to fill And browse the herbage of a distant hill She latch her door and bid With matron care her kid daughter as you live This portal do undo To any creature who This watchword does not give Deuce take the wolf and all his race
The wolf was passing near the place By chance and heard the words with pleasure And laid them up as useful treasure And hardly need we mention Escaped the goat attention
No sooner did he see The matron off than he With hypocritic tone and face Cried out before the place take the wolf and all his race
Not doubting thus to gain admission
The kid not void of all suspicion Peer through a crack and cried me white paw before You ask me to undo the door
The wolf could not if he had died For wolves have no connexion With paws of that complexion
So much surprised our gormandiser Retired to fast till he was wiser
How would the kid have been undone Had she but trusted to the word The wolf by chance had overheard
Two sureties better are than one And caution worth its cost Though sometimes seeming lost

THE WOLF THE MOTHER AND HER CHILD

This wolf another brings to mind Who found dame Fortune more unkind In that the greedy pirate sinner Was balk of life as well as dinner
As saith our tale a villager Dwelt in a by unguarded place There hungry watch our pillager For luck and chance to mend his case
For there his thievish eyes had seen All sorts of game go out and in Nice sucking calves and lambs and sheep And turkeys by the regiment With steps so proud and necks so bent They make a daintier glutton weep
The thief at length began to tire Of being gnaw by vain desire
Just then a child set up a cry still the mother said I Will throw you to the wolf you brat
ha
thought he talk is that
The gods be thank for luck so good
And ready at the door he stood When soothingly the mother said cry no more my little dear That naughty wolf if he comes here Your dear papa shall kill him dead

cried the veteran
this now that
Now hot now cool
Is this the way they change their metre
And do they take me for a fool
Some day a nutting in the wood That young one yet shall be my food
But little time has he to dote On such a feast the dogs rush out And seize the caitiff by the throat And country ditchers thick and stout With rustic spears and forks of iron The hapless animal environ
brought you here old head
cried one
He told it all as I have done
bless my soul
the frantic mother said villain eat my little son
And did I nurse the darling boy Your fiendish appetite to cloy
With that they knock him on the head
His feet and scalp they bore to town To grace the seigneur hall Where pinn against the wall This verse completed his renown Ye honest wolves believe not all That mothers say when children squall

THE WORDS OF SOCRATES

A house was built by Socrates That failed the public taste to please
Some blamed the inside some the out and all Agreed that the apartments were too small
Such rooms for him the greatest sage of Greece
ask said he greater bliss Than real friends to fill this
And reason had good Socrates To think his house too large for these
A crowd to be your friends will claim Till some unhandsome test you bring
There nothing plentier than the name There nothing rarer than the thing

THE OLD MAN AND HIS SONS

All power is feeble with dissension For this I quote the Phrygian slave
If aught I add to his invention It is our manners to engrave And not from any envious wishes I not so foolishly ambitious
Phaedrus enriches oft his story In quest I doubt it not of glory Such thoughts were idle in my breast
An aged man near going to his rest His gather sons thus solemnly address break this bunch of arrows you may try And first the string that binds them I untie
The eldest having tried with might and main Exclaim bundle I resign To muscles sturdier than mine
The second tried and bow himself in vain
The youngest took them with the like success
All were obliged their weakness to confess
Unharm the arrows pass from son to son Of all they did not break a single one
fellows
said their sire now must show What in the case my feeble strength can do
They laugh and thought their father but in joke Till one by one they saw the arrows broke
concord power
replied the sire long As you in love agree you will be strong
I go my sons to join our fathers good Now promise me to live as brothers should And soothe by this your dying father fears
Each strictly promised with a flood of tears
Their father took them by the hand and died And soon the virtue of their vows was tried
Their sire had left a large estate Involved in lawsuits intricate Here seized a creditor and there A neighbour levied for a share
At first the trio nobly bore The brunt of all this legal war
But short their friendship as was rare
Whom blood had join and small the wonder The force of interest drove asunder And as is wont in such affairs Ambition envy were
In parcelling their sire estate They quarrel quibble litigate Each aiming to supplant the other
The judge by turns condemns each brother
Their creditors make new assault Some pleading error some default
The sunder brothers disagree For counsel one have counsels three
All lose their wealth and now their sorrows Bring fresh to mind those broken arrows

THE ORACLE AND THE ATHEIST

That man his Maker can deceive Is monstrous folly to believe
The labyrinthine mazes of the heart Are open to His eyes in every part
Whatever one may do or think or feel From Him no darkness can the thing conceal
A pagan once of graceless heart and hollow Whose faith in gods I apprehensive Was quite as real as expensive
Consulted at his shrine the god Apollo
what I hold alive or not
Said he a sparrow having brought Prepared to wring its neck or let it fly As need might be to give the god the lie
Apollo saw the trick And answer quick or alive show me your sparrow And cease to set for me a trap Which can but cause yourself mishap
I see afar and far I shoot my arrow

THE MISER WHO HAD LOST HIS TREASURE

is use that constitutes possession
I ask that sort of men whose passion It is to get and never spend Of all their toil what is the end
What they enjoy of all their labours Which do not equally their neighbours
Throughout this upper mortal strife The miser leads a beggar life
Old Aesop man of hidden treasure May serve the case to demonstrate
He had a great estate But chose a second life to wait Ere he began to taste his pleasure
This man whom gold so little bless Was not possessor but possess
His cash he buried under ground Where only might his heart be found It being then his sole delight To ponder of it day and night And consecrate his rusty pelf A sacred offering to himself
In all his eating drinking travel Most wondrous short of funds he seem One would have thought he little dream Where lay such sums beneath the gravel
A ditcher mark his coming to the spot So frequent was it And thus at last some little inkling got Of the deposit
He took it all and babbled not
One morning ere the dawn Forth had our miser gone To worship what he loved the best When lo
he found an empty nest
Alas
what groaning wailing crying
What deep and bitter sighing
His torment makes him tear Out by the roots his hair
A passenger demandeth why Such marvellous outcry
got my gold
it gone it gone
gold
pray where
this stone
man is this a time of war That you should bring your gold so far
You better keep it in your drawer And I be bound if once but in it You could have got it any minute
any minute
Ah Heaven knows That cash comes harder than it goes
I touch it not
have the grace To explain to me that rueful face Replied the man if is true You touch it not how plain the case That put the stone back in its place And all will be as well for you

THE EYE OF THE MASTER

A stag took refuge from the chase Among the oxen of a stable Who counsel him as saith the fable To seek at once some safer place
brothers said the fugitive me not and as I live The richest pasture I will show That was grazed on high or low Your kindness you will not regret For well some day I pay the debt
The oxen promised secrecy
Down crouch the stag and breathed more free
At eventide they brought fresh hay As was their custom day by day And often came the servants near As did indeed the overseer But with so little thought or care That neither horns nor hide nor hair Reveal to them the stag was there
Already thank the stranger The oxen for their treatment kind And there to wait made up his mind Till he might issue free from danger
Replied an ox that chew the cud case looks fairly in the bud But then I fear the reason why Is that the man of sharpest eye Hath not yet come his look to take
I dread his coming for your sake Your boasting may be premature Till then poor stag you not secure
was but a little while before The careful master oped the door
this my boys
said he empty racks will never do
Go change this dirty litter too
More care than this I want to see Of oxen that belong to me
Well Jim my boy you young and stout What would it cost to clear these cobwebs out
And put these yokes and hames and traces All as they should be in their places
Thus looking round he came to see One head he did not usually
The stag is found his foes Deal heavily their blows
Down sinks he in the strife No tears can save his life
They slay and dress and salt the beast And cook his flesh in many a feast And many a neighbour gets a taste
As Phaedrus says it pithily The master is the eye to see I add the lover as for me

THE LARK AND HER YOUNG ONES WITH THE OWNER OF A FIELD

Depend upon yourself alone Has to a common proverb grown
is thus confirm in Aesop way The larks to build their nests are seen Among the young and green That is to say What time all things dame Nature heeding Betake themselves to love and breeding The monstrous whales and sharks Beneath the briny flood The tigers in the wood And in the fields the larks
One she however of these last Found more than half the past Without the taste of pleasures When firmly she set up her will That she would be a mother still And resolutely took her measures First got herself by Hymen match Then built her nest laid sat and hatch
All went as well as such things could
The ripening ere the brood Were strong enough to take their flight Aware how perilous their plight The lark went out to search for food And told her young to listen well And keep a constant sentinel
owner of this field said she come I know his grain to see
Hear all he says we little birds Must shape our conduct by his words
No sooner was the lark away Than came the owner with his son
wheat is ripe said he run And give our friends a call To bring their sickles all And help us great and small at the break of day
The lark returning found no harm Except her nest in wild alarm
Says one heard the owner say Go give our friends a call To help break of day
Replied the lark that is all We need not be in any fear But only keep an open ear
As gay as larks now eat your They ate and slept the great and littles
The dawn arrives but not the friends The lark soars up the owner wends His usual round to view his land
grain says he not to stand
Our friends do wrong and so does he Who trusts that friends will friendly be
My son go call our kith and kin To help us get our harvest in
This second order made The little larks still more afraid
sent for kindred mother by his son The work will now indeed be done
darlings go to sleep Our lowly nest we keep
With reason said for kindred there came none
Thus tired of expectation vain Once more the owner view his grain
son said he surely fools To wait for other people tools As if one might for love or pelf Have friends more faithful than himself
Engrave this lesson deep my son
And know you now what must be done
We must ourselves our sickles bring And while the larks their matins sing Begin the work and on this plan Get in our harvest as we can
This plan the lark no sooner knew Than the time she said chicks And taking little time to fix Away they flew All fluttering soaring often grounding Decamp without a trumpet sounding

BOOK
THE WOODMAN AND MERCURY

To The Chevalier De Bouillon

Your taste has served my work to guide To gain its suffrage I have tried
You have me shun a care too nice Or beauty at too dear a price Or too much effort as a vice
My taste with yours agrees Such effort can not please And too much pains about the polish Is apt the substance to abolish Not that it would be right or wise The graces all to ostracize
You love them much when delicate Nor is it left for me to hate
As to the scope of Aesop plan I fail as little as I can
If this my rhymed and measured speech Availeth not to please or teach I own it not a fault of mine Some unknown reason I assign
With little strength endued For battles rough and rude Or with Herculean arm to smite I show to vice its foolish plight
In this my talent wholly lies Not that it does at all suffice
My fable sometimes brings to view The face of vanity purblind With that of restless envy join And life now turns upon these pivots two
Such is the silly little frog That aped the ox upon her bog
A double image sometimes shows How vice and folly do oppose The ways of virtue and good sense As lambs with wolves so grim and gaunt The silly fly and frugal ant
Thus swells my work a comedy immense Its acts unnumber and diverse Its scene the boundless universe
Gods men and brutes all play their part In fields of nature or of art And Jupiter among the rest
Here comes the god who wont to bear Jove frequent errands to the fair With winged heels and haste But other work in hand

A man that labour in the wood Had lost his honest livelihood That is to say His axe was gone astray
He had no tools to spare This wholly earn his fare
Without a hope beside He sat him down and cried my axe
where can it be
O Jove
but send it back to me And it shall strike good blows for thee
His prayer in high Olympus heard Swift Mercury started at the word
axe must not be lost said he will you know it when you see
An axe I found upon the road
With that an axe of gold he show
this
The woodman answer
An axe of silver bright and gay Refused the honest woodman too
At last the finder brought to view An axe of iron steel and wood
mine he said in joyful mood that I quite contented be
The god replied give the three As due reward of honesty
This luck when neighbouring choppers knew They lost their axes not a few And sent their prayers to Jupiter So fast he knew not which to hear
His winged son however sent With gold and silver axes went
Each would have thought himself a fool Not to have own the richest tool
But Mercury promptly gave instead Of it a blow upon the head
With simple truth to be contented Is surest not to be repented But still there are who would With evil trap the good Whose cunning is but stupid For Jove is never dupèd

THE EARTHEN POT AND THE IRON POT

An iron pot proposed To an earthen pot a journey
The latter was opposed Expressing the concern he Had felt about the danger Of going out a ranger
He thought the kitchen hearth The safest place on earth For one so very brittle
thee who art a kettle And hast a tougher skin There nought to keep thee in
be thy Replied the iron pot anything that hard Should threaten thee a jot Between you I will go And save thee from the blow
This offer him persuaded
The iron pot paraded Himself as guard and guide Close at his cousin side
Now in their tripod way They hobble as they may And eke together bolt At every little jolt Which gives the crockery pain But presently his comrade hits So hard he dashes him to bits Before he can complain

Take care that you associate With equals only lest your fate Between these pots should find its mate

Aesop


THE LITTLE FISH AND THE FISHER

A little fish will grow If life be spared a great But yet to let him go And for his growing wait May not be very wise As is not sure your bait Will catch him when of size
Upon a river bank a fisher took A tiny troutling from his hook
Said he serve to count at least As the beginning of my feast And so I put it with the rest
This little fish thus caught His clemency besought
will your honour do with me
I not a mouthful as you see
Pray let me grow to be a trout And then come here and fish me out
Some alderman who likes things nice Will buy me then at any price
But now a hundred such you have to fish To make a single dish
well be it so replied the fisher little fish who play the preacher The must be your lot Although no doubt you like it not I fry the fry that can be got

In some things men of sense Prefer the present to the future tense

Aesop


THE EARS OF THE HARE

Some beast with horns did gore The lion and that sovereign dread Resolved to suffer so no more Straight banish from his realm is said All sorts of beasts with horns Rams bulls goats stags and unicorns
Such brutes all promptly fled
A hare the shadow of his ears perceiving Could hardly help believing That some vile spy for horns would take them And food for accusation make them
said he neighbour cricket I take my foreign ticket
My ears should I stay here Will turn to horns I fear And were they shorter than a bird I fear the effect of words
horns
the cricket answer God made them ears who can deny
said the coward they make them horns And horns perhaps of unicorns
In vain shall I protest With all the learning of the schools My reasons they will send to rest In th Hospital of Fools

THE FOX WITH HIS TAIL CUT OFF

A cunning old fox of plundering habits Great crauncher of fowls great catcher of rabbits Whom none of his sort had caught in a nap Was finally caught in somebody trap
By luck he escaped not wholly and hale For the price of his luck was the loss of his tail
Escaped in this way to save his disgrace He thought to get others in similar case
One day that the foxes in council were met wear we said he cumbering weight Which sweeps in the dirt wherever it goes
Pray tell me its use if any one knows
If the council will take my advice We shall dock off our tails in a trice
advice may be good said one on the ground ere I reply pray turn yourself round
Whereat such a shout from the council was heard Poor confounded could say not a word
To urge the reform would have wasted his breath
Long tails were the mode till the day of his death

Aesop Faerno


THE OLD WOMAN AND HER TWO SERVANTS

A beldam kept two spinning maids Who plied so handily their trades Those spinning sisters down below Were bunglers when compared with these
No care did this old woman know But giving tasks as she might please
No sooner did the god of day His glorious locks enkindle Than both the wheels began to play And from each whirling spindle Forth danced the thread right merrily And back was coil unceasingly
Soon as the dawn I say its tresses show A graceless cock most punctual crow
The beldam roused more graceless yet In greasy petticoat bedight Struck up her farthing light And then forthwith the bed beset Where deeply blessedly did snore Those two tired and poor
One oped an eye an arm one stretch And both their breath most sadly fetch This threat concealing in the sigh cursed cock shall surely die
And so he did they cut his throat And put to sleep his rousing note
And yet this murder mended not The cruel hardship of their lot For now the twain were scarce in bed Before they heard the summons dread
The beldam full of apprehension Lest oversleep should cause detention Ran like a goblin through her mansion
Thus often when one thinks To clear himself from ill His effort only sinks Him in the deeper still
The beldam acting for the cock Was Scylla for Charybdis rock

Aesop


THE SATYR AND THE TRAVELLER

Within a savage forest grot A satyr and his chips Were taking down their porridge hot Their cups were at their lips

You might have seen in mossy den Himself his wife and brood They had not like men But appetites as good

In came a traveller benighted All hungry cold and wet Who heard himself to eat invited With nothing like regret

He did not give his host the pain His asking to repeat But first he blew with might and main To give his fingers heat

Then in his steaming porridge dish He delicately blew
The wondering satyr said wish The use of both I knew

first my blowing warms my hand And then it cools my porridge

said his host understand I can not give you storage
sleep beneath one roof with you I may not be so bold
Far be from me that mouth untrue Which blows both hot and cold

Aesop


THE HORSE AND THE WOLF

A wolf what time the thawing breeze Renews the life of plants and trees And beasts go forth from winter lair To seek abroad their various fare A wolf I say about those days In sharp for means and ways Espied a horse turn out to graze
His joy the reader may opine
got said he game were fine But if a sheep sooner mine
I ca proceed my usual way Some trick must now be put in play
This said He came with measured tread As if a healer of disease Some pupil of Hippocrates And told the horse with learned verbs He knew the power of roots and herbs Whatever grew about those borders And not at all to flatter Himself in such a matter Could cure of all disorders
If he Sir Horse would not conceal The symptoms of his case He Doctor Wolf would gratis heal For that to feed in such a place And run about untied Was proof itself of some disease As all the books decide
have good doctor if you please Replied the horse I presume Beneath my foot an aposthume
son replied the learned leech part as all our authors teach Is strikingly susceptible Of ills which make acceptable What you may also have from me The aid of skilful surgery Which noble art the fact is For horses of the blood I practise
The fellow with this talk sublime Watch for a snap the fitting time
Meanwhile suspicious of some trick The wary patient nearer draws And gives his doctor such a kick As makes a chowder of his jaws
Exclaim the wolf in sorry plight own those heels have served me right
I err to quit my trade As I will not in future Me nature surely made For nothing but a butcher

THE PLOUGHMAN AND HIS SONS

The farmer patient care and toil Are oftener wanting than the soil

A wealthy ploughman drawing near his end Call in his sons apart from every friend And said of your sire bereft The heritage our fathers left Guard well nor sell a single field
A treasure in it is conceal The place precisely I do know But industry will serve to show
The harvest past Time forelock take And search with plough and spade and rake Turn over every inch of sod Nor leave unsearch a single clod
The father died
The sons and not in vain Turn the soil and again That year their acres bore More grain than before
Though hidden money found they none Yet had their father wisely done To show by such a measure That toil itself is treasure

Aesop


THE MOUNTAIN IN LABOUR

A mountain was in travail pang The country with her clamour rang
Out ran the people all to see Supposing that the birth would be A city or at least a house
It was a mouse

In thinking of this fable Of story feign and false But meaning veritable My mind the image calls Of one who writes The war I sing Which Titans waged against the
As on the sounding verses ring What will be brought to birth
Why dearth

FORTUNE AND THE BOY

Beside a well uncurb and deep A schoolboy laid him down to sleep Such rogues can do so anywhere
If some kind man had seen him there He would have leap as if distracted But Fortune much more wisely acted For passing by she softly waked the child Thus whispering in accents mild save your life my little dear And beg you not to venture here Again for had you fallen in I should have had to bear the sin But I demand in reason name If for your rashness I to blame
With this the goddess went her way
I like her logic I must say
There takes place nothing on this planet But Fortune ends began it
In all adventures good or ill We look to her to foot the bill
Has one a stupid empty pate That serves him never till too late He clears himself by blaming Fate

Aesop


THE DOCTORS

The selfsame patient put to test Two doctors and
The latter hoped the former did maintain The man would take all medicine in vain
By different cures the patient was beset But erelong cancell nature debt While nursed As was prescribed by
But over the disease both triumph still
Said one well foresaw his death
said the other my pill Would certainly have saved his breath

THE HEN WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS

How avarice loseth all By striving all to gain I need no witness call But him whose thrifty hen As by the fable we are told Laid every day an egg of gold
hath a treasure in her body Bethinks the avaricious noddy
He kills and opens vexed to find All things like hens of common kind
Thus spoil the source of all his riches To misers he a lesson teaches
In these last changes of the moon How often doth one see Men made as poor as he By force of getting rich too soon

Aesop


THE ASS CARRYING RELICS

An ass with relics for his load Supposed the worship on the road Meant for himself alone And took on lofty airs Receiving as his own The incense and the prayers
Some one who saw his great mistake Cried Donkey do not make Yourself so big a fool
Not you they worship but your pack They praise the idols on your back And count yourself a paltry tool

is thus a brainless magistrate Is honour for his robe of state

THE STAG AND THE VINE

A stag by favour of a vine Which grew where suns most genial shine And form a thick and matted bower Which might have turn a summer shower Was saved from ruinous assault
The hunters thought their dogs at fault And call them off
In danger now no more The stag a thankless wretch and vile Began to browse his benefactress
The hunters listening the while The rustling heard came back With all their yelping pack And seized him in that very place
is said he justice in my case
Let every black ingrate Henceforward profit by my fate
The dogs fell to wasting breath To pray those hunters at the death
They left and we will not revile A warning for profaners of asylum

THE SERPENT AND THE FILE

A serpent neighbour to a smith A neighbour bad to meddle with Went through his shop in search of food But nothing found is understood To eat except a file of steel Of which he tried to make a meal
The file without a spark of passion Address him in the following fashion simpleton
you surely bite With less of sense than appetite For ere from me you gain One quarter of a grain You break your teeth from ear to ear
Time are the only teeth I fear

This tale concerns those men of letters Who good for nothing bite their betters
Their biting so is quite unwise
Think you ye literary sharks Your teeth will leave their marks Upon the deathless works you criticise
Fie

THE HARE AND THE PARTRIDGE

Beware how you deride The exiles from life sunny side To you is little known How soon their case may be your own
On this sage Aesop gives a tale or two As in my verses I propose to do
A field in common share A partridge and a hare And live in peaceful state Till woeful to relate
The hunters mingled cry Compels the hare to fly
He hurries to his fort And spoils almost the sport By faulting every hound That yelps upon the ground
At last his reeking heat Betrays his snug retreat
Old Tray with philosophic nose Snuffs carefully and grows So certain that he cries hare is here bow wow
And veteran Ranger now The dog that never lies hare is gone replies
Alas
poor wretched hare Back comes he to his lair To meet destruction there
The partridge void of fear Begins her friend to jeer bragg of being fleet How serve you now your feet
Scarce has she ceased to speak The laugh yet in her beak When comes her turn to die From which she could not fly
She thought her wings indeed Enough for every need But in her laugh and talk Forgot the cruel hawk


THE EAGLE AND THE OWL

The eagle and the owl resolved to cease Their war embraced in pledge of peace
On faith of king on faith of owl they swore That they would eat each other chicks no more
know you mine
said Wisdom bird
I indeed the eagle cried
worse for that the owl replied fear your oath a useless word I fear that you as king will not Consider duly who or what You kings and gods of what before ye Are apt to make one category
Adieu my young if you should meet them
them then or let me greet them And on my life I will not eat them The eagle said
The owl replied little ones I say with pride For grace of form can not be match The prettiest birds that were hatch By this you can not fail to know them is needless therefore that I show them
Pray do forget but keep this mark in view Lest fate should curse my happy nest by you
At length God gives the owl a set of heirs And while at early eve abroad he fares In quest of birds and mice for food Our eagle haply spies the brood As on some craggy rock they sprawl Or nestle in some ruined wall But which it matters not at all And thinks them ugly little frights Grim sad with voice like shrieking sprites
chicks says he looks almost infernal Ca be the darlings of our friend nocturnal
I sup of them
And so he did not slightly He never sups if he can help it lightly
The owl return and sad he found Nought left but claws upon the ground
He pray the gods above and gods below To smite the brigand who had caused his woe
Quoth one you alone the blame must fall Or rather on the law of nature Which wills that every earthly creature Shall think its like the loveliest of all
You told the eagle of your young ones graces You gave the picture of their faces Had it of likeness any traces

Avianus also Verdizotti
The owl was the bird of Minerva as the eagle was that of Jupiter


THE LION GOING TO WAR

The lion had an enterprise in hand Held a sent his And gave the animals a call impartial Each in his way to serve his high command
The elephant should carry on his back The tools of war the mighty public pack And fight in elephantine way and form The bear should hold himself prepared to storm The fox all secret stratagems should fix The monkey should amuse the foe by tricks
said one blockhead asses And hares too cowardly and fleet
said the king use all classes Without their aid my force were incomplete
The ass shall be our trumpeter to scare Our enemy
And then the nimble hare Our royal bulletins shall homeward bear

A monarch provident and wise Will hold his subjects all of consequence And know in each what talent lies
There nothing useless to a man of sense

THE BEAR AND THE TWO COMPANIONS

Two fellows needing funds and bold A bearskin to a furrier sold Of which the bear was living still But which they presently would kill At least they said they would
And if their word was good It was a king of bears an Ursa Major The biggest bear beneath the sun
Its skin the chaps would wager Was cheap at double cost make one laugh at frost And make two robes as well as one
Old Dindenaut in sheep who dealt Less prized his sheep than they their pelt In their account was theirs But in his own the bears
By bargain struck upon the skin Two days at most must bring it in
Forth went the two
More easy found than got The bear came growling at them on the trot
Behold our dealers both confounded As if by thunderbolt astounded
Their bargain vanish suddenly in air For who could plead his interest with a bear
One of the friends sprung up a tree The other cold as ice could be Fell on his face feign death And closely held his breath He having somewhere heard it said The bear preys upon the dead
Sir Bear sad blockhead was deceived The prostrate man a corpse believed But half suspecting some deceit He feels and snuffs from head to feet And in the nostrils blows
The body surely dead he thinks
leave it says he it stinks And off into the woods he goes
The other dealer from his tree Descending cautiously to see His comrade lying in the dirt Consoling says is a wonder That by the monster forced asunder We after all more scared than hurt
But addeth he of the creature skin
He held his muzzle very near What did he whisper in your ear
gave this caution Never dare Again to sell the skin of bear Its owner has not ceased to wear

BOOK VI

THE SHEPHERD AND THE LION

Of fables judge not by their face They give the simplest brute a teacher place
Bare precepts were inert and tedious things The story gives them life and wings
But story for the story sake Were sorry business for the wise As if for pill that one should take You gave the sugary disguise
For reasons such as these Full many writers great and good Have written in this frolic mood And made their wisdom please
But tinsel style they all have shunn with care With them one never sees a word to spare
Of Phaedrus some have blamed the brevity While Aesop uses fewer words than he
A certain Greek however beats Them both in his larconic feats
Each tale he locks in verses four The well or ill I leave to critic lore
At Aesop side to see him let us aim Upon a theme substantially the same
The one selects a lover of the chase A shepherd comes the other tale to grace
Their tracks I keep though either tale may grow A little in its features as I go

The one which Aesop tells is nearly this A shepherd from his flock began to miss And long to catch the stealer of his sheep
Before a cavern dark and deep Where wolves retired by day to sleep Which he suspected as the thieves He set his trap among the leaves And ere he left the place He thus invoked celestial grace king of all the powers divine Against the rogue but grant me this delight That this my trap may catch him in my sight And I from twenty calves of mine Will make the fattest thine
But while the words were on his tongue Forth came a lion great and strong
Down crouch the man of sheep and said With shivering fright half dead
that man should never be aware Of what may be the meaning of his prayer
To catch the robber of my flocks O king of gods I pledged a calf to thee If from his clutches thou wilt rescue me I raise my offering to an ox

is thus the tells the story Now hear the rival of his glory

Aesop
certain La Fontaine
This is Babrias the Greek fabulist to whom La Fontaine gives the older form of his name
La Fontaine strictures on this rival of Aesop proceed from the fact that he read the author in the corrupted form of the edition by Ignatius Magister ninth century
It was not till a century after La Fontaine wrote that the fame of Babrias was cleared by Bentley and Tyrwhitt who brought his Fables to light in their original form
The is Aesop the rival Gabrias or Babrias
The last line refers the reader to the following fable for comparison
In the original editions of La Fontaine the two fables appear together with the heading Fables et II


THE LION AND THE HUNTER

A braggart lover of the chase Had lost a dog of valued race And thought him in a lion maw
He ask a shepherd whom he saw show me man the robber place And I have justice in the case
on this mountain side The shepherd man replied
tribute of a sheep I pay Each month and where I please I stray
Out leap the lion as he spake And came that way with agile feet
The braggart prompt his flight to take Cried O grant a safe retreat

A danger close at hand Of courage is the test
It shows us who will stand Whose legs will run their best

PHOEBUS AND BOREAS

Old Boreas and the sun one day Espied a traveller on his way Whose dress did happily provide Against whatever might betide
The time was autumn when indeed All prudent travellers take heed
The rains that then the sunshine dash And Iris with her splendid sash Warn one who does not like to soak To wear abroad a good thick cloak
Our man was therefore well bedight With double mantle strong and tight
fellow said the wind meant To guard from every ill event But little does he wot that I Can blow him such a blast That not a button fast His cloak shall cleave the sky
Come here a pleasant game Sir Sun
Wilt play
Said Phoebus
We bet between us here Which first will take the gear From off this cavalier
Begin and shut away
The brightness of my ray

Our blower on the bet Swell out his pursy form With all the stuff for storm The thunder hail and drenching wet And all the fury he could muster Then with a very demon bluster He whistled whirl and splash And down the torrents dash Full many a roof uptearing He never did before Full many a vessel bearing To wreck upon the shore And all to doff a single cloak
But vain the furious stroke The traveller was stout And kept the tempest out Defied the hurricane Defied the pelting rain And as the fiercer roar the blast His cloak the tighter held he fast
The sun broke out to win the bet He caused the clouds to disappear Refresh and warm the cavalier And through his mantle made him sweat Till off it came of course In less than half an hour And yet the sun saved half his So much doth mildness more than force

JUPITER AND THE FARMER

Of yore a farm had Jupiter to rent To advertise it Mercury was sent
The farmers far and near Flock round the terms to hear And calling to their aid The various tricks of trade One said was rash a farm to hire Which would so much expense require Another that do what you would The farm would still be far from good
While thus in market style its faults were told One of the crowd less wise than bold Would give so much on this condition That Jove would yield him altogether The choice and making of his weather That instantly on his decision His various crops should feel the power Of heat or cold of sun or shower

Jove yields
The bargain closed our man Rains blows and takes the care Of all the changes of the air On his peculiar private plan
His nearest neighbours felt it not And all the better was their lot
Their year was good by grace divine The grain was rich and full the vine
The renter failing altogether The next year made quite different weather And yet the fruit of all his labours Was far inferior to his neighbours
What better could he do
To Heaven He owns at last his want of sense And so is graciously forgiven
Hence we conclude that Providence Knows better what we need Than we ourselves indeed

Aesop and Faerno


THE COCKEREL THE CAT AND THE YOUNG MOUSE

A youthful mouse not up to trap Had almost met a sad mishap
The story hear him thus relate With great importance to his mother pass the mountain bounds of this estate And off was trotting on another Like some young rat with nought to do But see things wonderful and new When two strange creatures came in view
The one was mild benign and gracious The other turbulent rapacious With voice terrific shrill and rough And on his head a bit of stuff That look like raw and bloody meat Raised up a sort of arms and beat The air as if he meant to fly And bore his plumy tail on high

A cock that just began to crow As if some nondescript From far New Holland shipp Was what our mousling pictured so
beat his arms said he raised his voice And made so terrible a noise That I who thanks to Heaven may justly boast Myself as bold as any mouse Scud off his voice would even scare a ghost
And cursed himself and all his house For but for him I should have staid And doubtless an acquaintance made With her who seem so mild and good
Like us in velvet cloak and hood She wears a tail that full of grace A very sweet and humble face No mouse more kindness could desire And yet her eye is full of fire
I do believe the lovely creature A friend of rats and mice by nature
Her ears though like herself they bigger Are just like ours in form and figure
To her I was approaching when Aloft on what appear his den The other scream and off I fled
son his cautious mother said sweet one was the cat The mortal foe of mouse and rat Who seeks by smooth deceit Her appetite to treat
So far the other is from that We yet may eat His dainty meat Whereas the cruel cat she can devours No other meat than ours

Remember while you live It is by looks that men deceive

THE FOX THE MONKEY AND THE ANIMALS

Left kingless by the lion death The beasts once met our story saith Some fit successor to install
Forth from a moated place The crown was brought and taken from its case And being tried by turns on all The heads of most were found too small Some hornèd were and some too big Not one would fit the regal gear
For ever ripe for such a rig The monkey looking very queer Approach with antics and grimaces And after scores of monkey faces With what would seem a gracious stoop Pass through the crown as through a hoop
The beasts diverted with the thing Did homage to him as their king
The fox alone the vote regretted But yet in public never fretted
When he his compliments had paid To royalty thus newly made sire I know a place said he lies conceal a treasure Which by the right of royalty Should bide your royal pleasure
The king lack not an appetite For such financial pelf And not to lose his royal right Ran straight to see it for himself
It was a trap and he was caught
Said Renard you have it thought You ape that you can fill a throne And guard the rights of all alone Not knowing how to guard your own

The beasts all gather from the farce That stuff for kings is very scarce

THE MULE BOASTING OF HIS GENEALOGY

A prelate mule of noble birth was proud And talk incessantly and loud Of nothing but his dam the mare Whose mighty deeds by him recounted were This had she done and had been present there By which her son made out his claim To notice on the scroll of Fame
Too proud when young to bear a doctor pill When old he had to turn a mill
As there they used his limbs to bind His sire the ass was brought to mind
Misfortune were its only use The claims of folly to reduce And bring men down to sober reason Would be a blessing in its season

THE OLD MAN AND THE ASS

An old man riding on his ass Had found a spot of thrifty grass And there turn loose his weary beast
Old Grizzle pleased with such a feast Flung up his heels and caper round Then roll and rubb upon the ground And frisk and browsed and bray And many a clean spot made
Arm men came on them as he fed fly in haste the old man said
wherefore so
the ass replied heavier burdens will they ride
said the man already started
cried the ass as he departed stay and be no matter whose Save you yourself and leave me loose
But let me tell you ere you go I speak plain French you know My master is my only foe

THE STAG SEEING HIMSELF IN THE WATER

Beside a placid crystal flood A stag admired the branching wood That high upon his forehead stood But gave his Maker little thanks For what he call his spindle shanks
limbs are these for such a head So mean and slim
with grief he said
glorious heads The branches of the copse My legs are my disgrace
As thus he talk a bloodhound gave him chase
To save his life he flew Where forests thickest grew
His horns pernicious ornament Arresting him he went Did unavailing render What else in such a strife Had saved his precious life His legs as fleet as slender
Obliged to yield he cursed the gear Which nature gave him every year

Too much the beautiful we prize The useful often we despise Yet oft as happen to the stag The former doth to ruin drag

Aesop also Phaedrus


THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE

To win a race the swiftness of a dart Availeth not without a timely start
The hare and tortoise are my witnesses
Said tortoise to the swiftest thing that is bet that you not reach so soon as I The tree on yonder hill we spy
soon
Why madam are you frantic
Replied the creature with an antic take your senses to restore A grain or two of hellebore
said the tortoise you will I dare you to the wager still
was done the stakes were paid And near the goal tree laid Of what is not a question for this place Nor who it was that judged the race
Our hare had scarce five jumps to make Of such as he is wont to take When starting just before their beaks He leaves the hounds at leisure Thence till the kalends of the Greeks The sterile heath to measure
Thus having time to browse and doze And list which way the zephyr blows He makes himself content to wait And let the tortoise go her gait In solemn senatorial state
She starts she moils on modestly and lowly And with a prudent wisdom hastens slowly But he meanwhile the victory despises Thinks lightly of such prizes Believes it for his honour To take late start and gain upon her
So feeding sitting at his ease He meditates of what you please Till his antagonist he sees Approach the goal then starts Away like lightning darts But vainly does he run The race is by the tortoise won
Cries she senses do I lack
What boots your boasted swiftness now
You beat
and yet you must allow I bore my house upon my back

of the The Greeks unlike the Romans had no kalends in their computation of time hence the frequent use of this expression to convey the idea of an indefinite period of time


THE ASS AND HIS MASTERS

A gardener ass complain to Destiny Of being made to rise before the dawn
cocks their matins have not sung said he I am up and gone
And all for what
To market herbs it seems
Fine cause indeed to interrupt my dreams
Fate moved by such a prayer Sent him a currier load to bear Whose hides so heavy and were They almost choked the foolish beast
wish me with my former lord he said then he turn his head If on the watch I caught A which cost me nought
But in this horrid place I find No chance or windfall of the kind Or if indeed I do The cruel blows I rue
Anon it came to pass He was a collier ass
Still more complaint
now
said Fate Quite out of patience
on this jackass I must wait What will become of kings and nations
Has none but he aught here to tease him
Have I no business but to please him
And Fate had cause for all are so
Unsatisfied while here below Our present lot is aye the worst
Our foolish prayers the skies infest
Were Jove to grant all we request The din renew his head would burst

THE SUN AND THE FROGS

Rejoicing on their tyrant The people drown their care in drink While from the general joy did Aesop shrink And show its folly in this way
sun said he took it in his head To have a partner for his bed
From swamps and ponds and marshy bogs Up rose the wailings of the frogs
What shall we do should he have progeny
Said they to Destiny One sun we scarcely can endure And we are sure Will dry the very sea
Adieu to marsh and fen
Our race will perish then Or be obliged to fix Their dwelling in the Styx
For such an humble animal The frog I take it reason well

A countryman as Aesop certifies A charitable man but not so wise One day in winter found Stretch on the snowy ground A chill or frozen snake As torpid as a stake And if alive devoid of sense
He took him up and bore him home And thinking not what recompense For such a charity would come Before the fire stretch him And back to being fetch him
The snake scarce felt the genial heat Before his heart with native malice beat
He raised his head thrust out his forkèd tongue Coil up and at his benefactor sprung
wretch
said he this the way My care and kindness you repay
Now you shall die
With that his axe he takes And with two blows three serpents makes
Trunk head and tail were separate snakes And leaping up with all their might They vainly sought to reunite

is good and lovely to be kind But charity should not be blind For as to wretchedness ingrate You can not raise it from its wretched state

Aesop also Phaedrus


THE SICK LION AND THE FOX

Sick in his den we understand The king of beasts sent out command That of his vassals every sort Should send some deputies to court With promise well to treat Each deputy and suite On faith of lion duly written None should be scratch much less be bitten
The royal will was executed And some from every tribe deputed The foxes only would not come
One thus explain their choice of home those who seek the court we learn The tracks upon the sand Have one direction and Not one betokens a return
This fact begetting some distrust His majesty at present must Excuse us from his great levee
His plighted word is good no doubt But while how beasts get in we see We do not see how they get out

THE FOWLER THE HAWK AND THE LARK

From wrongs of wicked men we draw Excuses for our own Such is the universal law
Would you have mercy shown Let yours be clearly known

A fowler mirror served to snare The little tenants of the air
A lark there saw her pretty face And was approaching to the place
A hawk that sailed on high Like vapour in the sky Came down as still as infant breath On her who sang so near her death
She thus escaped the fowler steel The hawk malignant claws to feel
While in his cruel way The pirate pluck his prey Upon himself the net was sprung
fowler pray he in the hawkish tongue me in thy clemency
I never did a wrong to thee
The man replied true And did the lark to you

THE HORSE AND THE ASS

In such a world all men of every grade Should each the other kindly aid For if beneath misfortune goad A neighbour falls on you will fall his load

There jogg in company an ass and horse Nought but his harness did the last endorse The other bore a load that crush him down And begg the horse a little help to give Or otherwise he could not reach the town
prayer said he civil I believe One half this burden you would scarcely feel
The horse refused flung up a scornful heel And saw his comrade die beneath the weight And saw his wrong too late For on his own proud back They put the ass pack And over that beside They put the ass hide

THE CARTER IN THE MIRE

The Phaëton who drove a load of hay Once found his cart bemired
Poor man
the spot was far away From human help retired In some rude country place In Brittany as near as I can trace Near Quimper Corentan A town that poet never sang Which Fate they say puts in the traveller path When she would rouse the man to special wrath
May Heaven preserve us from that route
But to our carter hale and stout Fast stuck his cart he swore his worst And fill with rage extreme The now he cursed And now he cursed his team And now his cart and load Anon the like upon himself bestow
Upon the god he call at length Most famous through the world for strength
help me Hercules
cried he if thy back of yore This burly planet bore Thy arm can set me free
This prayer gone up from out a cloud there broke A voice which thus in godlike accents spoke suppliant must himself bestir Ere Hercules will aid confer
Look wisely in the proper quarter To see what hindrance can be found Remove the execrable mud and mortar Which beset thy wheels around
Thy sledge and crowbar take And pry me up that stone or break Now fill that rut upon the other side
Hast done it
the man replied
said the voice aid thee now Take up thy whip
have but how
My cart glides on with ease
I thank thee Hercules
team rejoin the voice light ado So help thyself and Heaven will help thee too

THE CHARLATAN

The world has never lack its charlatans More than themselves have lack their plans
One sees them on the stage at tricks Which mock the claims of sullen Styx
What talents in the streets they post
One of them used to boast Such mastership of eloquence That he could make the greatest dunce Another Tully Cicero In all the arts that lawyers know
sirs a dunce a country clown The greatest blockhead of your town Nay more an animal an ass The stupidest that nibbles grass Needs only through my course to pass And he shall wear the gown With credit honour and renown
The prince heard of it call the man thus spake stable holds a steed Of the Arcadian breed Of which an orator I wish to make
sire you can Replied our man
At once his majesty Paid the tuition fee
Ten years must roll and then the learned ass Should his examination pass According to the rules Adopted in the schools If not his teacher was to tread the air With halter neck above the public square His rhetoric bound on his back And on his head the ears of jack
A courtier told the rhetorician With bows and terms polite He would not miss the sight Of that last pendent exhibition For that his grace and dignity Would well become such high degree And on the point of being hung He would bethink him of his tongue And show the glory of his art The power to melt the hardest heart And wage a war with time By periods sublime A pattern speech for orators thus leaving Whose work is vulgarly call thieving

was the charlatan reply that the king the ass or I Shall one or other of us die
And reason good had he We count on life most foolishly Though hale and hearty we may be
In each ten years death cuts down one in three

DISCORD

The goddess Discord having made on high Among the gods a general grapple And thence a lawsuit for an apple Was turn out bag and baggage from the sky
The animal call man with open arms Received the goddess of such naughty charms Herself and her brother With her stingy mother
In this the lower universe Our hemisphere she chose to curse For reasons good she did not please To visit our antipodes Folks rude and savage like the beasts Who from forms and priests In simple tent or leafy bower Make little work for such a power
That she might know exactly where Her direful aid was in demand Renown flew courier through the land Reporting each dispute with care Then she outrunning Peace was quickly there And if she found a spark of ire Was sure to blow it to a fire
At length Renown got out of patience At random hurrying the nations And not without good reason thought A goddess like her mistress ought To have some fix and certain home To which her customers might come For now they often search in vain
With due location it was plain She might accomplish vastly more And more in season than before
To find the right facilities Was harder then than now it is For then there were no nunneries

So Hymen inn at last assign Thence lodged the goddess to her mind

La Fontaine gentle reader does not mean to say that Discord lodges with all married people but that the foul fiend is never better satisfied than when she can find such Translator


THE YOUNG WIDOW

A husband death brings always sighs The widow sobs sheds tears then dries
Of Time the sadness borrows wings And Time returning pleasure brings
Between the widow of a year And of a day the difference Is so immense That very few who see her Would think the laughing dame And weeping one the same
The one puts on repulsive action The other shows a strong attraction
The one gives up to sighs or true or false The same sad note is heard whoever calls
Her grief is inconsolable They say
Not so our fable Or rather not so says the truth

To other worlds a husband went And left his wife in prime of youth
Above his dying couch she bent And cried love O wait for me
My soul would gladly go with thee
But yet it did not go
The fair one sire a prudent man Check not the current of her woe
At last he kindly thus began child your grief should have its bound
What boots it him beneath the ground That you should drown your charms
Live for the living not the dead
I do propose that you be led At once to Hymen arms But give me leave in proper time To rearrange the broken chime With one who is as good at least In all respects as the deceased

she sigh cloister vows Befit me better than a spouse
The father left the matter there
About one month thus mourn the fair Another month her weeds arranged Each day some robe or lace she changed Till mourning dresses served to grace And took of ornament the place
The frolic band of loves Came flocking back like doves
Jokes laughter and the dance The native growth of France Had finally their turn And thus by night and morn She plunged to tell the truth Deep in the fount of youth
Her sire no longer fear The dead so much endear But as he never spoke Herself the silence broke is that youthful spouse said she sir you lately promised me

EPILOGUE

Here check we our career Long books I greatly fear
I would not quite exhaust my stuff The flower of subjects is enough
To me the time is come it seems To draw my breath for other themes
Love tyrant of my life commands That other work be on my hands
I dare not disobey
Once more shall Psyche be my lay
I call by Damon to portray Her sorrows and her joys
I yield perhaps while she employs My muse will catch a richer glow And well if this my labour strain Shall be the last and only pain Her spouse shall cause me here below

Cupid the spouse of Psyche
The other work on my hands mentioned in this Epilogue the end of the poet first collection of Fables was no doubt the writing of his Psyche which was addressed to his patron the Duchess de Bouillon and published in the year following the publication of the first six Books of the Fables

BOOK VII

To Madame De Montespan
The apologue is from the immortal gods Or if the gift of man it is Its author merits apotheosis
Whoever magic genius lauds Will do what in him lies To raise this art inventor to the skies
It hath the potence of a charm On dulness lays a conquering arm Subjects the mind to its control And works its will upon the soul
O lady arm with equal power If within celestial bower With messmate gods reclined My muse ambrosially hath dined Lend me the favour of a smile On this her playful toil
If you support the tooth of time will shun And let my work the envious years outrun
If authors would themselves survive To gain your suffrage they should strive
On you my verses wait to get their worth To you my beauties all will owe their birth For beauties you will recognize Invisible to other eyes
Ah
who can boast a taste so true Of beauty or of grace In either thought or face
For words and looks are equal charms in you
Upon a theme so sweet the truth to tell My muse would gladly dwell But this employ to others I must yield A greater master claims the field
For me fair lady enough Your name should be my wall and roof
Protect henceforth the favour book Through which for second life I look
In your auspicious light These lines in envy spite Will gain the glorious meed That all the world shall read
is not that I deserve such fame I only ask in Fable name You know what credit that should claim And if successfully I sue A fane will be to Fable due A thing I would not build except for you

THE ANIMALS SICK OF THE PLAGUE

The sorest ill that Heaven hath Sent on this lower world in wrath The plague to call it by its name One single day of which Would Pluto ferryman enrich Waged war on beasts both wild and tame
They died not all but all were sick No hunting now by force or trick To save what might so soon expire
No food excited their desire Nor wolf nor fox now watch to slay The innocent and tender prey
The turtles fled So love and therefore joy were dead
The lion council held and said friends I do believe This awful scourge for which we grieve Is for our sins a punishment Most righteously by Heaven sent
Let us our guiltiest beast resign A sacrifice to wrath divine
Perhaps this offering truly small May gain the life and health of all
By history we find it noted That lives have been just so devoted
Then let us all turn eyes within And ferret out the hidden sin
Himself let no one spare nor flatter But make clean conscience in the matter
For me my appetite has play the glutton Too much and often upon mutton
What harm had my victims done
I answer truly None
Perhaps sometimes by hunger press I eat the shepherd with the rest
I yield myself if need there be And yet I think in equity Each should confess his sins with me For laws of right and justice cry The guiltiest alone should die
said the fox majesty Is humbler than a king should be And in the case
What
eating stupid sheep a crime
No never sire at any time
It rather was an act of grace A mark of honour to their race
And as to shepherds one may swear The fate your majesty describes Is recompense less full than fair For such usurpers our tribes

Thus Renard glibly spoke And loud applause from flatterers broke
Of neither tiger boar nor bear Did any keen inquirer dare To ask for crimes of high degree The fighters biters scratchers all From every mortal sin were free The very dogs both great and small Were saints as far as dogs could be

The ass confessing in his turn Thus spoke in tones of deep concern happen through a mead to pass The monks its owners were at mass Keen hunger leisure tender grass And add to these the devil too All tempted me the deed to do
I browsed the bigness of my tongue Since truth must out I own it wrong

On this a hue and cry arose As if the beasts were all his foes A wolf haranguing Denounced the ass for sacrifice The scabby ragged lout By whom the plague had come no doubt
His fault was judged a hanging crime

eat another grass
O shame
The noose of rope and death sublime For that offence were all too tame
And soon poor Grizzle felt the same

Thus human courts acquit the strong And doom the weak as therefore wrong

One of the most original as well as one of the most beautiful of the poet fables yet much of the groundwork of its story may be traced in the Fables of Bidpaii and other collections

THE

If worth were not a thing more rare Than beauty in this planet fair There would be then less need of care About the contracts Hymen closes
But beauty often is the bait To love that only ends in hate And many hence repent too late Of wedding thorns from wooing roses
My tale makes one of these poor fellows Who sought relief from marriage vows Send back again his tedious spouse Contentious covetous and jealous With nothing pleased or satisfied This restless bride Some fault in every one descried
Her good man went to bed too soon Or lay in bed till almost noon
Too cold too hot too black too white Were on her tongue from morn till night
The servants mad and madder grew The husband knew not what to do
was you never think or care And that price we can not bear And you never stay at home And I wish you would just come Till finally such ceaseless dearing Upon her husband patience wearing Back to her sire he sent his wife To taste the sweets of country life To dance at will the country jigs And feed the turkeys geese and pigs
In course of time he hoped his bride Might have her temper mollified Which hope he duly put to test
His wife recall said he went with you your rural rest From vexing cares and fashions free
Its peace and quiet did you gain Its innocence without a stain
of all said she then To see those idle worthless men Neglect the flocks it gave me pain
I told them plainly what I thought And thus their hatred quickly bought For which I do not care not I
madam did her spouse reply still your temper so morose And tongue so virulent that those Who only see you morn and night Are quite grown weary of the sight What then must be your servants case Who needs must see you face to face Throughout the day
And what must be the harder lot Of him I pray Whose days and nights With you must be by marriage rights
Return you to your father cot
If I recall you in my life Or even wish for such a wife Let Heaven in my hereafter send Two such to tease me without end

The badinage of La Fontaine having been misunderstood the translator has altered the introduction to this fable
The intention of the fable is to recommend prudence and good nature not celibacy
So the peerless Granville understands it for his pencil tells us that the hero of the fable did finally recall his wife notwithstanding his fearful imprecation
It seems that even she was better than Translator in his sixth edition


THE RAT RETIRED FROM THE WORLD

The sage Levantines have a tale About a rat that weary grew Of all the cares which life assail And to a Holland cheese withdrew
His solitude was there profound Extending through his world so round
Our hermit lived on that within And soon his industry had been With claws and teeth so good That in his novel hermitage He had in store for wants of age Both house and livelihood
What more could any rat desire
He grew fair fat and round
blessings thus redound To those who in His vows retire
One day this personage devout Whose kindness none might doubt Was ask by certain delegates That came from For some small aid for they To foreign parts were on their way For succour in the great
Ratopolis beleaguer sore Their whole republic drain and poor No morsel in their scrips they bore
Slight boon they craved of succour sure In days at utmost three or four
friends the hermit said worldly things I dead
How can a poor recluse To such a mission be of use
What can he do but pray That God will aid it on its way
And so my friends it is my prayer That God will have you in his care
His saintship said no more But in their faces shut the door
What think you reader is the service For which I use this niggard rat
To paint a monk
No but a dervise
A monk I think however fat Must be more bountiful than that

THE HERON

One day no matter when or where A heron chanced to fare By a certain river brink With his long sharp beak Helved on his slender neck was a you might think
The water was clear and still The carp and the pike there at will Pursued their silent fun Turning up ever and anon A golden side to the sun
With ease might the heron have made Great profits in his fishing trade
So near came the scaly fry They might be caught by the
But he thought he better might Wait for a better appetite For he lived by rule and could not eat Except at his hours the best of meat
Anon his appetite return once more So approaching again the shore He saw some tench taking their leaps Now and then from their lowest deeps
With as dainty a taste as Horace rat He turn away from such food as that
tench for a heron
poh
I scorn the thought and let them go
The tench refused there came a gudgeon all that said the bird budge on
I open my beak if the gods please For such mean little fishes as these
He did it for less For it came to pass That not another fish could he see And at last so hungry was he That he thought it of some avail To find on the bank a single snail
Such is the sure result Of being too difficult
Would you be strong and great Learn to accommodate
Get what you can and trust for the rest The whole is oft lost by seeking the best
Above all things beware of disdain Where at most you have little to gain
The people are many that make Every day this sad mistake
is not for the herons I put this case Ye featherless people of human race

THE MAID

A certain maid as proud as fair A husband thought to find Exactly to her mind and young genteel in air Not cold nor jealous mark this well
would wed this dainty belle Must have besides rank wealth and wit And all good qualities to fit A man difficult to get
Kind Fate however took great care To grant if possible her prayer
There came men of note The maiden thought them all By half too mean and small
marry me
the creatures dote Alas
poor souls
their case I pity
Here mark the bearing of the beauty
Some were less delicate than witty Some had the nose too short or long In others something else was wrong Which made each in the maiden eyes An altogether worthless prize
Profound contempt is aye the vice Which springs from being Thus were the great dismiss and then Came offers from inferior men
The maid more scornful than before Took credit to her tender heart For giving then an open door
think me much in haste to part With independence
God be thank My lonely nights bring no regret Nor shall I pine or greatly fret Should I with ancient maids be rank
Such were the thoughts that pleased the fair Age made them only thoughts that were
Adieu to lovers passing years Awaken doubts and chilling fears
Regret at last brings up the train
Day after day she sees with pain Some smile or charm take final flight And leave the features of a
Then came a hundred sorts of paint But still no trick nor ruse nor feint Avail to hide the cause of grief Or bar out Time that graceless thief
A house when gone to wreck and ruin May be repair and made a new one
Alas
for ruins of the face No such rebuilding takes place
Her daintiness now changed its tune Her mirror told her soon
So did a certain wish within With more of secrecy than sin A wish that dwells with even prudes Annihilating solitudes
This maiden choice was past belief She soothing down her restless grief And smoothing it of every ripple By marrying a cripple

This fable should be read in conjunction with the foregoing one


THE WISHES

Within the Great Mogul domains there are Familiar sprites of much domestic use They sweep the house and take a tidy care Of equipage nor garden work refuse But if you meddle with their toil The whole at once you sure to spoil
One near the mighty Ganges flood The garden of a burgher good Work noiselessly and well To master mistress garden bore A love that time and toil outwore And bound him like a spell
Did friendly zephyrs blow The demon pains to aid
For so they do is said
I own I do not know
But for himself he rested not And richly bless his master lot
What mark his strength of love He lived a fixture on the place In spite of tendency to rove So natural to his race
But brother sprites conspiring With importunity untiring So teased their goblin chief that he Of his caprice or policy Our sprite commanded to attend A house in Norway farther end Whose roof was through the year And shelter human kind with deer
Before departing to his hosts Thus spake this best of busy ghosts foreign parts I forced to go
For what sad fault I do not know But go I must a month delay Or week perhaps and I away
Seize time three wishes make at will For three I able to fulfil No more
Quick at their easy task Abundance first these wishers ask Abundance with her stores unlock Barns coffers cellars larder stock Corn cattle wine and money The overflow of milk and honey
But what to do with all this wealth
What inventories cares and worry
What wear of temper and of health
Both lived in constant slavish hurry
Thieves took by plot and lords by loan The king by tax the poor by tone
Thus felt the curses which Arise from being rich this affluence
they pray The poor are happier than they Whose riches make them slaves
treasures to the winds and waves Come goddess of the quiet breast Who toil with rest Dear Mediocrity return
The prayer was granted as we learn
Two wishes thus expended Had simply ended In bringing them exactly where When they set out they were
So usually it fares With those who waste in such vain prayers The time required by their affairs
The goblin laugh and so did they
However ere he went away To profit by his offer kind They ask for wisdom wealth of mind A treasure void of care and sorrow A treasure fearless of the morrow Let who will steal or beg or borrow



THE LION COURT

His lion majesty would know one day What bestial tribes were subject to his sway
He therefore gave his vassals all By deputies a call Despatching everywhere A written circular Which bore his seal and did import His majesty would hold his court A month most splendidly A feast would open his levee Which done Sir Jocko sleight Would give the court delight
By such sublime magnificence The king would show his power immense

Now were they gather all Within the royal And such a hall
The charnel scent Would make the strongest nerves relent
The bear put up his paw to close The double access of his nose
The act had better been omitted His throne at once the monarch quitted And sent to Pluto court the bear To show his delicacy there
The ape approved the cruel deed A thorough flatterer by breed
He praised the prince wrath and claws He praised the odour and its cause
Judged by the fragrance of that cave The amber of the Baltic wave The rose the pink the hawthorn bank Might with the vulgar garlic rank
The mark his flattery overshot And made him share poor Bruin lot This lion playing in his way The part of Don Caligula
The fox approach
said the king your nostrils to this thing And let me hear without disguise The judgment of a beast so wise
The fox replied Majesty will please Excuse and here he took good care to sneeze with a dreadful cold Your majesty need not be told My sense of smell is mostly gone

From danger thus withdrawn He teaches us the while That one to gain the smile Of kings must hold the middle place blunt rebuke and fulsome praise And sometimes use with easy grace The language of the Norman race

THE VULTURES AND THE PIGEONS

Mars once made havoc in the air Some cause aroused a quarrel there Among the birds not those that sing The courtiers of the merry Spring And by their talk in leafy bowers Of loves they feel enkindle ours Nor those which Cupid mother yokes To whirl on high her golden spokes But naughty hawk and vulture folks Of hooked beak and talons keen
The carcass of a dog is said Had to this civil carnage led
Blood rain upon the swarded green And valiant deeds were done I ween
But time and breath would surely fail To give the fight in full detail Suffice to say that chiefs were slain And heroes strow the sanguine plain Till old Prometheus in his chains Began to hope an end of pains
was sport to see the battle rage And valiant hawk with hawk engage was pitiful to see them fall Torn bleeding weltering gasping all
Force courage cunning all were plied Intrepid troops on either side No effort spared to populate The dusky realms of hungry Fate
This woful strife awoke compassion Within another feather nation Of iris neck and tender heart
They tried their hand at mediation To reconcile the foes or part
The pigeon people duly chose Ambassadors who work so well As soon the murderous rage to quell And stanch the source of countless woes
A truce took place and peace ensued
Alas
the people dearly paid Who such pacification made
Those cursed hawks at once pursued The harmless pigeons slew and ate Till towns and fields were desolate
Small prudence had the friends of peace To pacify such foes as these

The safety of the rest requires The bad should flesh each other spears Whoever peace with them desires Had better set them by the ears

THE COACH AND THE FLY

Upon a sandy uphill road Which naked in the sunshine glow Six lusty horses drew a coach
Dames monks and invalids its load On foot outside at leisure trode
The team all weary stopp and blow Whereon there did a fly approach And with a vastly business air
Cheer up the horses with his buzz Now pricked them here now prick them there As neatly as a jockey does And thought the while he knew was so He made the team and carriage go On sometimes alighting Or driver nose and biting
And when the whole did get in motion Confirm and settled in the notion He took himself the total glory Flew back and forth in wondrous hurry And as he buzz about the cattle Seem like a sergeant in a battle The files and squadrons leading on To where the victory is won
Thus charged with all the commonweal This single fly began to feel Responsibility too great And cares a grievous crushing weight And made complaint that none would aid The horses up the tedious hill The monk his prayers at leisure said Fine time to pray the dames at will Were singing songs not greatly needed
Thus in their ears he sharply sang And notes of indignation ran Notes after all not greatly heeded
Erelong the coach was on the top said the fly hearties stop And breathe I got you up the hill And Horses let me say I need not ask you if you will A proper compensation pay

Thus certain noddies Are seen in every great affair Important swelling And bores is easier to bear Than chase them from their needless care

THE DAIRYWOMAN AND THE POT OF MILK

A pot of milk upon her cushion crown Good Peggy hasten to the market town Short clad and light with speed she went Not fearing any accident Indeed to be the nimbler tripper Her dress that day The truth to say Was simple petticoat and slipper
And thus bedight Good Peggy light Her gains already counted Laid out the cash At single dash Which to a hundred eggs amounted
Three nests she made Which by the aid Of diligence and care were hatch
raise the chicks I easy fix Said she our cottage thatch
The fox must get More cunning yet Or leave enough to buy a pig
With little care And any fare He grow quite fat and big And then the price Will be so nice For which the pork will sell
go quite hard But in our yard I bring a cow and calf to dwell A calf to frisk among the flock
The thought made Peggy do the same And down at once the came And perish with the shock
Calf cow and pig and chicks adieu
Your mistress face is sad to view She gives a tear to fortune spilt Then with the downcast look of guilt Home to her husband empty goes Somewhat in danger of his blows

Who buildeth not sometimes in air His cots or seats or castles fair
From kings to dairy women all The wise the foolish great and small Each thinks his waking dream the best
Some flattering error fills the breast The world with all its wealth is ours Its honours dames and loveliest bowers
Instinct with valour when alone I hurl the monarch from his throne The people glad to see him dead Elect me monarch in his stead And diadems rain on my head
Some accident then calls me back And I no more than simple Jack

This and the following fable should be read together

THE CURATE AND THE CORPSE

A dead man going slowly sadly To occupy his last abode A curate by him rather gladly Did holy service on the road
Within a coach the dead was borne A robe around him duly worn Of which I wot he was not proud That ghostly garment call a shroud
In summer blaze and winter blast That robe is changeless is the last
The curate with his priestly dress on Recited all the church prayers The psalm the verse response and lesson In fullest style of such affairs
Sir Corpse we beg you do not fear A lack of such things on your bier They give abundance every way Provided only that you pay
The Reverend John Cabbagepate Watch the corpse as if it were A treasure needing guardian care And all the while his looks elate This language seem to hold dead will pay so much in gold So much in lights of molten wax So much in other sorts of tax With all he hoped to buy a cask of wine The best which thereabouts produced the vine
A pretty niece on whom he doted And eke his chambermaid should be promoted By being newly petticoated
The coach upset and dash to pieces Cut short these thoughts of wine and nieces
There lay poor John with broken head Beneath the coffin of the dead
His rich parishioner in lead Drew on the priest the doom Of riding with him to the tomb

The Pot of Milk and fate Of Curate Cabbagepate As emblems do but give The history of most that live

This fable is founded upon a fact which is related by Madame de Sévigné in her under date as follows Boufflers has killed a man since his death the circumstance was this they were carrying him about a league from Boufflers to inter him the corpse was on a bier in a coach his own curate attended it the coach overset and the bier falling upon the curate neck choaked him
de Boufflers had fallen down dead a few days before
He was the eldest brother of the Duke de Boufflers
In another March Madame de Sévigné says Here is Fontaine fable too on the adventure of de Boufflers curate who was killed in the coach by his dead patron
There was something very extraordinary in the affair itself the fable is pretty but not to be compared to the one that follows it I do not understand the
This allusion to the preceding fable must be the which Madame de Sévigné did not understand last note Madame can hardly have meant the fable which is easily understood
She often saw La Fontaine work before it was published and the date of her letter quoted at shows that she must so have seen the Curate and the Corpse and that perhaps without so seeing the Dairywoman and the Pot of Milk


THE MAN WHO RAN AFTER FORTUNE AND THE MAN WHO WAITED FOR HER IN HIS BED

Who joins not with his restless race To give Dame Fortune eager chase
O had I but some lofty perch From which to view the panting crowd Of dreamers poor and proud As on they hurry in the search From realm to realm land and water Of Fate fantastic fickle daughter
Ah
slaves sincere of flying phantom
Just as their goddess they would clasp The jilt divine eludes their grasp And flits away to Bantam
Poor fellows
I bewail their lot
And here the comfort of my ditty For fools the mark of wrath are not So much I sure as pity
man say they and feed their hope cabbages and now he pope
Do we deserve as rich a prize
Ay richer
But hath Fortune eyes
And then the popedom is it worth The price that must be given Repose the sweetest bliss of earth And ages since of gods in heaven
is rarely Fortune favourites Enjoy this cream of all delights
Seek not the dame and she will you A truth which of her sex is true

Snug in a country town A pair of friends were settled down
One sigh unceasingly to find A fortune better to his mind And as he chanced his friend to meet Proposed to quit their dull retreat
prophet can to honour come Said he he quits his home Let seek our fortune far and wide
if you please his friend replied one I do not wish to see A better clime or destiny
I leave the search and prize to you Your restless humour please pursue
You soon come back again
I vow to nap it here till then
The enterprising or ambitious Or if you please the avaricious Betook him to the road
The morrow brought him to a place The flaunting goddess ought to grace As her particular abode I mean the court whereat he staid And plans for seizing Fortune laid
He rose and dress and dined and went to bed Exactly as the fashion led In short he did he could But never found the promised good
Said he somewhere else I try And yet I fail I know not why For Fortune here is much at home To this and that I see her come Astonishingly kind to some
And truly it is hard to see The reason why she slips from me
is true perhaps as I been told That spirits here may be too bold
To courts and courtiers all I bid adieu Deceitful shadows they pursue
The dame has temples in Surat I go and see them that is flat
To say so was t embark at once
O human hearts are made of bronze
His must have been of adamant Beyond the power of Death to daunt Who ventured first this route to try And all its frightful risks defy
was more than once our venturous wight Did homeward turn his aching sight When pirate rocks and calms and storms Presented death in frightful forms Death sought with pains on distant shores Which soon as wish for would have come Had he not left the peaceful doors Of his despised but blessed home
Arrived at length in Hindostan The people told our wayward man That Fortune ever void of plan Dispensed her favours in Japan
And on he went the weary sea His vessel bearing lazily
This lesson taught by savage men Was after all his only gain Contented in thy country stay And seek thy wealth in nature way
Japan refused to him no less Than Hindostan success And hence his judgment came to make His quitting home a great mistake
Renouncing his ungrateful course He hasten back with all his force And when his village came in sight His tears were proof of his delight
happy he exclaimed the wight dwelling there with mind sedate Employs himself to regulate His wild desires Who checks his heart when it aspires To know of courts and seas and glory More than he can by simple story Who seeks not the treacherous wave More treacherous Fortune willing slave The bait of wealth and honours fleeting Held by that goddess aye retreating
Henceforth from home I budge no more
Pop on his sleeping friends he came Thus purposing against the dame And found her sitting at his door

THE TWO COCKS

Two cocks in peace were living when A war was kindled by a hen
O love thou bane of Troy
was thine The blood of men and gods to shed Enough to turn the Xanthus red As old Port wine
And long the battle doubtful stood I mean the battle of the cocks They gave each other fearful shocks The fame spread the neighbourhood And gather all the crested brood
And Helens more than one of plumage bright Led off the victor of that bloody fight
The vanquish drooping fled Conceal his batter head And in a dark retreat Bewail his sad defeat
His loss of glory and the prize His rival now enjoy before his eyes
While this he every day beheld His hatred kindled courage swell He whet his beak and flapp his wings And meditated dreadful things
Waste rage
His rival flew upon a roof And crow to give his victory A hawk this boasting heard Now perish all his pride As suddenly he died Beneath that savage bird
In consequence of this reverse The vanquish sallied from his hole And took the harem master sole For moderate penance not the worse
Imagine the congratulation The proud and stately leading Gallanting coaxing feeding Of wives almost a nation
is thus that Fortune loves to flee The insolent by victory
We should mistrust her when we beat Lest triumph lead us to defeat

THE INGRATITUDE AND INJUSTICE OF MEN TOWARDS FORTUNE

A trader on the sea to riches grew Freight after freight the winds in favour blew Fate steer him clear gulf rock nor shoal Of all his bales exacted toll
Of other men the powers of chance and storm Their dues collected in substantial form While smiling Fortune in her kindest sport Took care to waft his vessels to their port
His partners factors agents faithful proved His goods tobacco sugar spice Were sure to fetch the highest price
By fashion and by folly loved His rich brocades and laces And splendid porcelain vases Enkindling strong desires Most readily found buyers
In short gold rain he went Abundance more than could be spent Dogs horses coaches downy bedding His very fasts were like a wedding
A bosom friend a look his table giving Inquired whence came such sumptuous living
should it come said he superb of brow from the fountain of my knowing how
I owe it simply to my skill and care In risking only where the marts will bear
And now so sweet his swelling profits were He risk anew his former gains Success rewarded not his pains His own imprudence was the cause
One ship went awreck Another felt of arms the lack When pirates trampling on the laws and bore it off a prize
A third arriving at its port Had fail to sell its merchandize The style and folly of the court Not now requiring such a sort
His agents factors fail in short The man himself from pomp and princely cheer And palaces and parks and dogs and deer Fell down to poverty most sad and drear
His friend now meeting him in shabby plight Exclaim whence comes this to pass
Fortune said the man
yourself replied the friendly wight if to make you rich the dame denies She ca forbid you to be wise

What faith he gain I do not wis I know in every case like this Each claims the credit of his bliss And with a heart ingrate Imputes his misery to Fate

THE HEAD AND THE TAIL OF THE SERPENT

Two parts the serpent has Of men the enemies The head and tail the same Have won a mighty fame Next to the cruel Fates So that indeed hence They once had great debates About precedence
The first had always gone ahead The tail had been for ever led And now to Heaven it pray And said many and many a league Dragg on in sore fatigue Behind his back I go
Shall he for ever use me so
Am I his humble servant No
Thanks to God most fervent
His brother I was born And not his slave forlorn
The blood in both I just as good as he A poison dwells in me As virulent as doth In him
In mercy heed And grant me this decree That I in turn may lead My brother follow me
My course shall be so wise That no complaint shall rise

With cruel kindness Heaven granted The very thing he blindly wanted To such desires of beasts and men Though often deaf it was not then
At once this novel guide That saw no more in broad daylight Than in the murk of darkest night His powers of leading tried Struck trees and men and stones and bricks And led his brother straight to Styx
And to the same unlovely home Some states by such an error come

AN ANIMAL IN THE MOON

While one philosopher affirms That by our senses we deceived Another swears in plainest terms The senses are to be believed
The twain are right
Philosophy Correctly calls us dupes Upon mere senses we rely
But when we wisely rectify The raw report of eye or ear By distance medium circumstance In real knowledge we advance
These things hath nature wisely plann Whereof the proof shall be at hand
I see the sun its dazzling glow Seems but a here below But should I see it in its home That azure dome Of all the universe the eye Its blaze would fill one half the sky
The powers of trigonometry Have set my mind from blunder free
The ignorant believe it flat I make it round instead of that
I fasten fix on nothing ground it And send the earth to travel round it
In short I contradict my eyes And sift the truth from constant lies
The mind not hasty at conclusion Resists the onset of illusion Forbids the sense to get the better And believes it to the letter
Between my eyes perhaps too ready And ears as much or more too slow A judge with balance true and steady I come at last some things to know
Thus when the water crooks a stick My reason straightens it as quick Kind Mistress Reason foe of error And best of shields from needless terror
The creed is common with our race The moon contains a woman face
True
No
Whence then the notion From mountain top to ocean
The roughness of that satellite Its hills and dales of every grade Effect a change of light and shade Deceptive to our feeble sight So that besides the human face All sorts of creatures one might trace
Indeed a living beast I ween Has lately been by England seen
All duly placed the telescope And keen observers full of hope An animal entirely new In that fair planet came to view
Abroad and fast the wonder flew Some change had taken place on high Presaging earthly changes nigh Perhaps indeed it might betoken The wars that had already broken Out wildly the Continent
The king to see the wonder went As patron of the sciences No right to go more plain than his
To him in turn distinct and clear This lunar monster did A mouse between the lenses caged Had caused these wars so fiercely waged
No doubt the happy English folks Laugh at it as the best of jokes
How soon will Mars afford the chance For like amusements here in France
He makes us reap broad fields of glory
Our foes may fear the For us it is no sooner found Than Louis with fresh laurels crown Bears higher up our country story
The daughters too of Memory The Pleasures and the Graces Still show their cheering faces We wish for peace but do not sigh
The English Charles the secret knows To make the most of his repose
And more than this he know the way By valour working sword in hand To bring his land To share the fight it only sees
Yet could he but this quarrel quell What would grateful swell
What deed more worthy of his fame

DEATH AND THE DYING

Death never taketh by surprise The to wit the wise They knowing of themselves the time To meditate the final change of clime
That time alas
embraces all Which into hours and minutes we divide There is no part however small That from this tribute one can hide
The very moment oft which bids The heirs of empire see the light Is that which shuts their fringèd lids In everlasting night
Defend yourself by rank and wealth Plead beauty virtue youth and health Unblushing Death will ravish all The world itself shall pass beneath his pall
No truth is better known but truth to say No truth is oftener thrown away

A man well in his second century Complain that Death had call him suddenly Had left no time his plans to fill To balance books or make his will
Death said he ye call it fair Without a warning to prepare To take a man on lifted leg
O wait a little while I beg
My wife can not be left alone I must set out my nephew son And let me build my house a wing Before you strike O cruel king
man said Death thing is sure My visit here not premature
Hast thou not lived a century
Darest thou engage to find for me
In Paris walls two older men Has France among her millions ten
Thou I should have sent thee word Thy lamp to trim thy loins to gird And then my coming had been meet Thy will engross Thy house complete
Did not thy feelings notify
Did not they tell thee thou must die
Thy taste and hearing are no more Thy sight itself is gone before For thee the sun superfluous shines And all the wealth of Indian mines Thy mates I shown thee dead or dying
What this indeed but notifying
Come on old man without reply For to the great and common weal It doth but little signify Whether thy will shall ever feel The impress of thy hand and seal

And Death had reason ghastly sage
For surely man at such an age Should part from life as from a feast Returning decent thanks at least To Him who spread the various cheer And unrepining take his bier For shun it long no creature can
Repinest thou man
See younger mortals rushing by To meet their death without a sigh Death full of triumph and of fame But in its terrors still the But ah
my words are thrown away
Those most like Death most dread his sway

THE COBBLER AND THE FINANCIER

A cobbler sang from morn till night was sweet and marvellous to hear His trills and quavers told the ear Of more contentment and delight Enjoy by that laborious wight Than enjoy the sages seven Or any mortals short of heaven
His neighbour on the other hand With gold in plenty at command But little sang and slumber less A financier of great success
If he dozed at break of day The cobbler song drove sleep away And much he wish that Heaven had made Sleep a commodity of trade In market sold like food and drink So much an hour so much a wink
At last our songster did he call To meet him in his princely hall
Said he honest Gregory What may your yearly earnings be
yearly earnings
faith good sir I never go at once so far The cheerful cobbler said And queerly scratch his head never reckon in that way But cobble on from day to day Content with daily bread

Well Gregory pray What may your earnings be per day
sometimes more and sometimes less
The worst of all I must confess And but for which our gains would be A pretty sight indeed to see Is that the days are made so many In which we can not earn a penny The sorest ill the poor man feels They tread upon each other heels Those idle days of holy saints
And though the year is shingled The parson keeps more
With smiles provoked by these complaints Replied the lordly financier give you better cause to sing
These hundred pounds I hand you here Will make you happy as a king
Go spend them with a frugal heed They long supply your every need
The cobbler thought the silver more Than he had ever dream before The mines for ages could produce Or world with all its people use
He took it home and there did hide And with it laid his joy aside
No more of song no more of sleep But cares suspicions in their stead And false alarms by fancy fed
His eyes and ears their vigils keep And not a cat can tread the floor But seems a thief slipp through the door
At last poor man
Up to the financier he ran Then in his morning nap profound give me back my songs cried he sleep that used so sweet to be And take the money every pound

parson keeps more Under the old regime of France the parish priest of each church had usually every Sunday at sermon time to announce more than one religious fast or feast for the coming week which the poor at least were expected to observe


THE LION THE WOLF AND THE FOX

A lion old and impotent with gout Would have some cure for age found out
Impossibilities on all occasions With kings are rank abominations
This king from every species For each abounds in every sort Call to his aid the leeches
They came in throngs to court From doctors of the highest fee To without degree Advised prescribed talk learnedly But with the rest Came not Sir Cunning Fox
Sir Wolf the royal couch attended And his suspicions there express
Forthwith his majesty offended Resolved Sir Cunning Fox should come And sent to smoke him from his home
He came was duly usher in And knowing where Sir Wolf had been Said your royal ear Has been abused I fear By rumours false and insincere To wit that I been From coming here through sheer contempt
But sire I been on pilgrimage By vow expressly made Your royal health to aid And on my way met doctors sage In skill the wonder of the age Whom carefully I did consult About that great debility Term in the books senility Of which you fear with reason the result
You lack they say the vital heat By age extreme become effete
Drawn from a living wolf the hide Should warm and smoking be applied
The secret good beyond a doubt For nature weak and wearing out
Sir Wolf here wo refuse to give His hide to cure you as I live
The king was pleased with this advice
Flay jointed served up in a trice Sir Wolf first wrapp the monarch up Then furnish him whereon to sup

Beware ye courtiers lest ye gain By slander arts less power than pain For in the world where ye are living A pardon no one thinks of giving

THE POWER OF FABLES

To De Barillon

Can diplomatic dignity To simple fables condescend
Can I your famed benignity Invoke my muse an ear to lend
If once she dares a high intent Will you esteem her impudent
Your cares are weightier indeed Than listening to the sage debates Of rabbit or of weasel states So as it pleases burn or read But save us from the woful harms Of Europe roused in hostile arms
That from a thousand other places Our enemies should show their faces May well be granted with a smile But not that England Isle Our friendly kings should set Their fatal blades to whet
Comes not the time for Louis to repose
What Hercules against these hydra foes Would not grow weary
Must new heads oppose His energy of blows
Now if your gentle powers As sweet as mighty in this world of ours Can soften hearts and lull this war to sleep I pile your altars with a hundred sheep And this is not a small affair For a Parnassian mountaineer
Meantime if you have time to spare Accept a little
A homely but an ardent prayer And tale in verse I give you here
I only say the theme is fit for you
With praise which envy must confess To worth like yours is justly due No man on earth needs propping less

In Athens once that city fickle An orator awake to feel His country in a dangerous pickle Would sway the proud republic heart Discoursing of the common weal As taught by his tyrannic art
The people listen not a word
Meanwhile the orator recurr To bolder tropes enough to rouse The dullest blocks that did drowse He clothed in life the very dead And thunder all that could be said
The wind received his breath As to the ear of death
That beast of many heads and light The crowd accustom to the sound Was all intent upon a sight A brace of lads in mimic fight
A new resource the speaker found
in lower tone said he forth her harvest fields to see An eel as such a fish might he And swallow were her company
A river check the travellers three
Two cross it soon without ado The smooth eel swam the swallow Outcried the crowd With voices loud Ceres what did she
what she pleased but first Yourselves she justly cursed A people puzzling aye your brains With children tales and children play While Greece puts on her steel array To save her limbs from tyrant chains
Why ask you not what Philip does
At this reproach the idle buzz Fell to the silence of the grave Or moonstruck sea without a wave And every eye and ear awoke To drink the words the patriot spoke
This feather stick in Fable cap
We all Athenians mayhap And I for one confess the sin For while I write this moral here If one should tell that tale so queer Ycleped I think The Ass Skin I should not mind my work a pin
The world is old they say I do deny it But infant still In taste and will would teach must gratify it

THE MAN AND THE FLEA

Impertinent we tease and weary Heaven With prayers which would insult mere mortals even
seem that not a god in all the skies From our affairs must ever turn his eyes And that the smallest of our race Could hardly eat or wash his face Without like Greece and Troy for ten years space Embroiling all Olympus in the case

A flea some blockhead shoulder bit And then his clothes refused to quit
Hercules he cried ought to purge This world of this far worse than hydra scourge
O Jupiter what are your bolts about They do not put these foes of mine to rout

To crush a flea this fellow fingers under The gods must lend the fool their club and thunder

THE WOMEN AND THE SECRET

There nothing like a secret weighs Too heavy is for women tender And for this matter in my days I seen some men of female gender

To prove his wife a husband cried The night he knew the truth would hide Heavens
What this
O dear I beg I torn O
O
I laid an egg
egg
yes it
Look here see feel it fresh and new But wife do mention it lest men Should laugh at me and call me hen Indeed do say a word about it
On this as other matters green and young The wife all wonder did not doubt it And pledged herself by Heaven to hold her tongue
Her oath however fled the light As quick as did the shades of night
Before Dan Phoebus waked to labour The dame was off to see a neighbour
friend she said
come to pass the strangest thing If you should tell turn me out of door My husband laid an egg as big as four
As you would taste of heaven bliss Do tell a living soul of this
tell
why if you knew a thing about me You would for an instant doubt me Your confidence I abuse
The layer wife went home relieved The other broil to tell the news You need not ask if she believed
A dame more busy could not be In twenty places ere her tea Instead of one egg she said three
Nor was the story finish here A gossip still more keen than she Said four and spoke it in the ear A caution truly little worth Applied to all the ears on earth
Of eggs the number thanks to Fame As on from mouth to mouth she sped Had grown a hundred soothly said Ere Sol had quench his golden flame

THE DOG THAT CARRIED HIS MASTER DINNER

Our eyes are not made proof against the fair Nor hands against the touch of gold
Fidelity is sadly rare And has been from the days of old
Well taught his appetite to check And do full many a handy trick A dog was trotting light and quick His master dinner on his neck
A temperate dog was he More than with such a load he liked to be
But still he was while many such as we Would not have scrupled to make free
Strange that to dogs a virtue you may teach Which do your best to men you vainly preach
This dog of ours thus richly fitted out A mastiff met who wish the meat no doubt
To get it was less easy than he thought The porter laid it down and fought
Meantime some other dogs arrive Such dogs are always thick enough And fearing neither kick nor cuff Upon the public thrive
Our hero thus and press The meat in danger manifest Is fain to share it with the rest And looking very calm and wise anger gentlemen he cries morsel will myself suffice The rest shall be your welcome prize
With this the first his charge to violate He snaps a mouthful from his freight
Then follow mastiff cur and pup Till all is cleanly eaten up
Not sparingly the party feasted And not a dog of all but tasted

In some such manner men abuse Of towns and states the revenues
The sheriffs aldermen and mayor Come in for each a liberal share
The strongest gives the rest example is sport to see with what a zest They sweep and lick the public chest Of all its funds however ample
If any commonweal defender Should dare to say a single word He shown his scruples are absurd And finds it easy to surrender Perhaps to be the first offender


THE JOKER AND THE FISHES

Some seek for jokers I avoid
A joke must be to be enjoy Of wisdom words by wit employ
God never meant for men of sense The wits that joke to give offence

Perchance of these I shall be able To show you one preserved in fable
A joker at a banker table Most amply spread to satisfy The height of epicurean wishes Had nothing near but little fishes
So taking several of the fry He whisper to them very nigh And seem to listen for reply
The guests much wonder what it meant And stared upon him all intent
The joker then with sober face Politely thus explain the case friend of mine to India bound Has been I fear Within a year By rocks or tempests wreck and drown
I ask these strangers from the sea To tell me where my friend might be
But all replied they were too young To know the least of such a matter The older fish could tell me better
Pray may I hear some older tongue
What relish had the gentlefolks For such a sample of his jokes Is more than I can now relate
They put I sure upon his plate A monster of so old a date He must have known the names and fate Of all the daring voyagers Who following the moon and stars Have by mischances sunk their bones Within the realms of Davy Jones And who for centuries had seen Far down within the fathomless Where whales themselves are sceptreless The ancients in their halls of green

THE RAT AND THE OYSTER
A country rat of little brains Grown weary of inglorious rest Left home with all its straws and grains Resolved to know beyond his nest
When peeping through the nearest fence big the world is how immense
He cried rise the Alps and that Is doubtless famous Ararat
His mountains were the works of moles Or dirt thrown up in digging holes
Some days of travel brought him where The tide had left the oysters bare
Since here our traveller saw the sea He thought these shells the ships must be
father was in truth said he coward and an ignoramus He dared not travel as for me I seen the ships and ocean famous Have cross the deserts without drinking And many dangerous streams unshrinking Such things I know from having seen and felt them
And as he went in tales he proudly dealt them Not being of those rats whose knowledge Comes by their teeth on books in college
Among the one Was gaping widely at the sun It breathed and drank the air perfume Expanding like a flower in bloom
Both white and fat its meat Appear a dainty treat
Our rat when he this shell espied Thought for his stomach to provide
not mistaken in the matter Said he meat was ever fatter Or in its flavour half so fine As that on which I dine
Thus full of hope the foolish chap Thrust in his head to taste And felt the pinching of a trap The oyster closed in haste

We first instructed by this case That those to whom the world is new Are at every view And in the second place That the marauder finds his match And he is caught who thinks to catch

THE BEAR AND THE AMATEUR GARDENER

A certain mountain bear unlick and rude By fate confined within a lonely wood A new Bellerophon whose life Knew neither comrade friend nor wife Became insane for reason as we term it Dwells never long with any hermit
is good to mix in good society Obeying rules of due propriety And better yet to be alone But both are ills when overdone
No animal had business where All grimly dwelt our hermit bear Hence bearish as he was he grew and long for something new
While he to sadness was addicted An aged man not far from there Was by the same disease afflicted
A garden was his favourite care Sweet Flora priesthood light and fair And eke Pomona ripe and red The presents that her fingers shed
These two employments true are sweet When made so by some friend discreet
The gardens gaily as they look Talk not except in this my book So tiring of the deaf and dumb Our man one morning left his home Some company to seek That had the power to The bear with thoughts the same Down from his mountain came And in a solitary place They met each other face to face
It would have made the boldest tremble What did our man
To play the Gascon The safest seem
He put the mask on His fear contriving to dissemble
The bear unused to compliment Growl bluntly but with good intent home with me
The man replied Bear my lodgings nearer by In yonder garden you may spy Where if you honour me the while We break our fast in rural style
I fruits and milk unworthy fare It may be for a wealthy bear But then I offer what I have
The bear accepts with visage grave But not unpleased and on their way They grow familiar friendly gay
Arrived you see them side by side As if their friendship had been tried
To a companion so absurd Blank solitude were well preferr Yet as the bear scarce spoke a word The man was left quite at his leisure To trim his garden at his pleasure
Sir Bruin hunted always brought His friend whatever game he caught But chiefly aim at driving flies Those hold and shameless parasites That vex us with their ceaseless bites From off our gardener face and eyes
One day while stretch upon the ground The old man lay in sleep profound A fly that buzz around his nose And bit it sometimes I suppose Put Bruin sadly to his trumps
At last determined up he jumps stop thy noisy buzzing now Says he know precisely how
No sooner said than done
He seized a And by his modus operandi Did both the fly and man die

A foolish friend may cause more woe Than could indeed the wisest foe

Their friendship faithful and refined Our country ca exceed do what it may
One night when potent Sleep had laid All still within our planet shade One of the two gets up alarm Runs over to the other palace And hastily the servants rallies
His startled friend quick arm With purse and sword his comrade meets And thus right kindly greets seldom at such an hour I take thee for a man of sounder mind Than to abuse the time for sleep design
Hast lost thy purse by Fortune power
Here mine
Hast suffer insult or a blow I here my sword to avenge it let us go
said his friend need I feel Of either silver gold or steel I thank thee for thy friendly zeal
In sleep I saw thee rather sad And thought the truth might be as bad
Unable to endure the fear That cursed dream has brought me here

If doubtful this one truth may be proposed There nothing sweeter than a real friend Not only is he prompt to lend An angler delicate he fishes The very deepest of your wishes And spares your modesty the task His friendly aid to ask
A dream a shadow wakes his fear When pointing at the object dear

THE HOG THE GOAT AND THE SHEEP

A goat a sheep and porker fat All to the market rode together
Their own amusement was not that Which caused their journey thither
Their coachman did not mean to them down To see the shows and wonders of the town
The porker cried in piercing squeals As if with butchers at his heels
The other beasts of milder mood The cause by no means understood
They saw no harm and wonder why At such a rate the hog should cry
there old piggy
said the man keep as quiet as you can
What wrong have you to squeal about And raise this shout
These stiller persons at your side Have manners much more dignified
Pray have you heard A single word Come from that gentleman in wool
That proves him wise
proves him fool
The testy hog replied did he know To what we go He cry almost to split his throat So would her ladyship the goat
They only think to lose with ease The goat her milk the sheep his fleece They maybe right but as for me This ride is quite another matter
Of service only on the platter My death is quite a certainty
Adieu my dear old piggery
The porker logic proved at once Himself a prophet and a dunce

Hope ever gives a present ease But fear beforehand kills The wisest he who least foresees Inevitable ills

THYRSIS AND AMARANTH

For Mademoiselle De Sillery

I had the Phrygian quit Charm with Italian wit But a divinity Would on Parnassus see A fable more from me
Such challenge to refuse Without a good excuse Is not the way to use Divinity or muse
Especially to one Of those who truly are By force of being fair Made queens of human will
A thing should not be done In all respects so For be it known to all From Sillery the call Has come for bird and beast And insects to the least To clothe their thoughts sublime In this my simple rhyme
In saying Sillery All said that need to be
Her claim to it so good Few fail to give her place Above the human race How could they if they would

Now come we to our end As she opines my tales Are hard to comprehend For even genius fails Some things to understand So let us take in hand To make unnecessary For once a commentary
Come shepherds now and rhyme we afterwards The talk between the wolves and fleecy herds

To Amaranth the young and fair Said Thyrsis once with serious air if you knew like me a certain ill With which we men are harm As well as strangely charm No boon from Heaven your heart could like it fill
Please let me name it in your ear A harmless word you need not fear
Would I deceive you you for whom I bear The tenderest sentiments that ever were
Then Amaranth replied is its name
I beg you do not hide LOVE
The word is beautiful
reveal Its signs and symptoms how it makes one feel
pains are ecstacies
So sweet its stings The and of kings Compared are flat insipid things
One strays all lonely in the wood Leans silent the placid flood And there with great complacency A certain face can see is not one own but image fair Retreating Fleeting Meeting Greeting Following everywhere
For all the rest of human kind One is as good in short as blind
There is a shepherd wight I ween Well known upon the village green Whose voice whose name whose turning of the hinge Excites upon the cheek a richer tinge The thought of whom is signal for a sigh The breast that heaves it knows not why Whose face the maiden fears to see Yet none so welcome still as he
Here Amaranth cut short his speech
O
is that the evil which you preach
To me I think it is no stranger I must have felt its power and danger
Here Thrysis thought his end was gain When further thus the maid explain just the very sentiment Which I have felt for Clidamant
The other vex and mortified Now bit his lips and nearly died

Like him are multitudes who when Their own advancement they have meant Have play the game of other men

THE FUNERAL OF THE LIONESS

The lion consort died Crowds gather at his side Must needs console the prince And thus their loyalty evince By compliments of course Which make affliction worse
Officially he cites His realm to funeral rites At such a time and place His marshals of the mace Would order the affair
Judge you if all came there
Meantime the prince gave way To sorrow night and day
With cries of wild lament His cave he rent
And from his courtiers far and near Sounds imitative you might hear

The court a country seems to me Whose people are no matter what Sad gay indifferent or not As suits the will of majesty Or if unable so to be Their task it is to seem it all Chameleons monkeys great and small
seem one spirit serves a thousand bodies A paradise indeed for soulless noddies

But to our tale again The stag graced not the funeral train Of tears his cheeks bore not a stain For how could such a thing have been When death avenged him on the queen Who not content with taking one Had choked to death his wife and son
The tears in truth refused to run
A flatterer who watch the while Affirm that he had seen him smile
If as the wise man somewhere saith A king is like a lion wrath What should King Lion be but death
The stag however could not read Hence paid this proverb little heed And walk intrepid the throne When thus the king in fearful tone caitiff of the wood
to laugh at such a time
Joins not thy voice the mournful chime
We suffer not the blood Of such a wretch profane Our sacred claws to stain
Wolves let a sacrifice be made Avenge your mistress awful shade
did the stag reply The time for tears is quite gone by For in the flowers not far from here Your worthy consort did appear Her form in spite of my surprise I could not fail to recognise
My friend said she beware Lest funeral pomp about my bier When I shall go with gods to share Compel thine eye to drop a tear
With kindred saints I rove In the Elysian grove And taste a sort of bliss Unknown in worlds like this
Still let the royal sorrow flow Its proper season here below is not unpleasing I confess
The king and court scarce hear him out
Up goes the loud and welcome shout miracle
an apotheosis
And such at once the fashion is So far from dying in a ditch The stag retires with presents rich

Amuse the ear of royalty With pleasant dreams and flattery No matter what you may have done Nor yet how high its wrath may run The bait is swallow object won

THE RAT AND THE ELEPHANT

One own importance to enhance Inspirited by Is quite a common thing in France A French disease it well might seem
The strutting cavaliers of Spain Are in another manner vain
Their pride has more insanity More silliness our vanity
Let shadow forth our own disease Well worth a hundred tales like these

A rat of quite the smallest size Fix on an elephant his eyes And jeer the beast of high descent Because his feet so slowly went
Upon his back three stories high There sat beneath a canopy A certain sultan of renown His dog and cat and concubine His parrot servant and his wine All pilgrims to a distant town
The rat profess to be amazed That all the people stood and gazed With wonder as he pass the road Both at the creature and his load
if said he occupy A little more of land or sky Made one in view of common sense Of greater worth and consequence
What see ye men in this parade That food for wonder need be made
The bulk which makes a child afraid
In truth I take myself to be In all aspects as good as he
And further might have gone his vaunt But darting down the cat Convinced him that a rat Is smaller than an elephant


THE HOROSCOPE

On death we mortals often run Just by the roads we take to shun

A father only heir a son Was and doted on So greatly that astrology Was question what his fate might be
The man of stars this caution gave That until twenty years of age No lion even in a cage The boy should see his life to save
The sire to silence every fear About a life so very dear Forbade that any one should let His son beyond his threshold get
Within his palace walls the boy Might all that heart could wish enjoy Might with his mates walk leap and run And frolic in the wildest fun
When come of age to love the chase That exercise was oft depicted To him as one that brought disgrace To which but blackguards were addicted
But neither warning nor derision Could change his ardent disposition
The youth fierce restless full of blood Was prompted by the boiling flood To love the dangers of the wood
The more opposed the stronger grew His mad desire
The cause he knew For which he was so closely pent And as he went In that magnificent abode Both tapestry and canvas show The feats he did so much admire A painted lion roused his ire
monster
cried he in his rage is you that keep me in my cage
With that he clinch his fist To strike the harmless beast And did his hand impale Upon a hidden nail
And thus this cherish head For which the healing art But vainly did its part Was hurried to the dead By caution blindly meant To shun that sad event

The poet Aeschylus is said By much the same precaution bled
A conjuror foretold A house would crush him in its fall Forth sallied he though old From town and hall And took his lodgings wet or dry Abroad beneath the open sky
An eagle bearing through the air A tortoise for her household fare Which first she wish to break The creature dropp by sad mistake Plump on the poet forehead bare As if it were a naked rock To Aeschylus a fatal shock

From these examples it appears This art if true in any wise Makes men fulfil the very fears Engender by its prophecies
But from this charge I justify By branding it a total lie
I do believe that Nature powers Have tied her hands or pinion ours By marking on the heavenly vault Our fate without mistake or fault
That fate depends upon conjunctions Of places persons times and tracks And not upon the functions Of more or less of quacks
A king and clown beneath one planet nod Are born one wields a sceptre one a hod
But it is Jupiter that wills it so
And who is he
A soulless clod
How can he cause such different powers to flow Upon the aforesaid mortals here below
And how indeed to this far distant ball Can he impart his energy at all How pierce the ether deeps profound The sun and globes that whirl around
A mote might turn his potent ray For ever from its earthward way
Will find it then in starry cope The makers of the horoscope
The war with which all Europe now afflicted Deserves it not by them to been predicted
Yet heard we not a whisper of it Before it came from any prophet
The suddenness of passion gush Of wayward life the headlong rush Permit they that the feeble ray Of twinkling planet far away Should trace our winding zigzag course
And yet this planetary force As steady as it is unknown These fools would make our guide alone Of all our varied life the source
Such doubtful facts as I relate The petted child and poet fate Our argument may well admit
The blindest man that lives in France The smallest mark would doubtless hit Once in a thousand times by chance

who is By Jupiter the soulless clod is of course meant the planet not the god

THE ASS AND THE DOG

Dame Nature our respected mother Ordains that we should aid each other

The ass this ordinance neglected Though not a creature
Along the road a dog and he One master follow silently
Their master slept meanwhile the ass Applied his nippers to the grass Much pleased in such a place to stop Though there no thistle he could crop
He would not be too delicate Nor spoil a dinner for a plate Which but for that his favourite dish Were all that any ass could wish

dear companion Towser said as a starving dog I ask it Pray lower down your loaded basket And let me get a piece of bread
No answer not a word indeed The truth was our Arcadian steed Fear lest for every moment flight His nimble teeth should lose a bite
At last counsel you said he wait Till master is himself awake Who then unless I much mistake Will give his dog the usual bait
Meanwhile there issued from the wood A creature of the wolfish brood Himself by famine sorely pinch
At sight of him the donkey flinch And begg the dog to give him aid
The dog budged not but answer made counsel thee my friend to run Till master nap is fairly done There can indeed be no mistake That he will very soon awake Till then scud off with all your might And should he snap you in your flight This ugly wolf why let him feel The greeting of your heel
I do not doubt at all but that Will be enough to lay him flat
But ere he ceased it was too late The ass had met his cruel fate

Thus selfishness we reprobate

THE PASHAW AND THE MERCHANT

A trading Greek for want of law Protection bought of a pashaw And like a nobleman he paid Much rather than a man of trade Protection being A costly sort of merchandise
So costly was it in this case The Greek complain with tongue and face
Three other Turks of lower rank Would guard his substance as their own And all draw less upon his bank Than did the great pashaw alone
The Greek their offer gladly heard And closed the bargain with a word
The said pashaw was made aware And counsel with a prudent care These rivals to anticipate By sending them to heaven gate As messengers to Mahomet Which measure should he much delay Himself might go the way By poison offer secretly Sent on before his time to be Protector to such arts and trades As flourish in the world of shades
On this advice the Turk no gander Behaved himself like Alexander
Straight to the merchant firm and stable He went and took a seat at table
Such calm assurance there was seen Both in his words and in his mien That that Grecian Could not suspect him of suspicion
friend said he know you quit me And some think caution would befit me Lest to despatch me be your plan But deeming you too good a man To injure either friends or foes With poison cups or secret blows I drown the thought and say no more
But as regards the three or four Who take my place I crave your grace To listen to an apologue

shepherd with a single dog Was ask the reason why He kept a dog whose least supply Amounted to a loaf of bread For every day
The people said He better give the animal To guard the village seignior hall For him a shepherd it would be A thriftier economy To keep small curs say two or three That would not cost him half the food And yet for watching be as good
The fools perhaps forgot to tell If they would fight the wolf as well
The silly shepherd giving heed Cast off his dog of mastiff breed And took three dogs to watch his cattle Which ate far less but fled in battle
His flock such counsel lived to rue As doubtlessly my friend will you
If wise my aid again you seek And so persuaded did the Greek

Not vain our tale if it convinces Small states that is a wiser thing To trust a single powerful king Than half a dozen petty princes

THE USE OF KNOWLEDGE

Between two citizens A controversy grew
The one was poor but much he knew The other rich with little sense Claim that in point of excellence The merely wise should bow the knee To all such money men as he
The merely fools he should have said For why should wealth hold up its head When merit from its side hath fled
friend quoth To his reverse think yourself considerable
Pray tell me do you keep a table
What comes of this incessant reading In point of lodging clothing feeding
It gives one true the highest chamber One coat for June and for December His shadow for his sole attendant And hunger always in th ascendant
What profits he his country too Who scarcely ever spends a sou Will haply be a public charge
Who profits more the state at large Than he whose luxuries dispense Among the people wealth immense
We set the streams of life We set all sorts of trades
The spinner weaver sewer vender And many a wearer fair and tender All live and flourish on the spender As do indeed the reverend rooks Who waste their time in making books
These words so full of impudence Received their proper recompense
The man of letters held his peace Though much he might have said with ease
A war avenged him soon and well In it their common city fell
Both fled abroad the ignorant By fortune thus brought down to want Was treated everywhere with scorn And roamed about a wretch forlorn Whereas the scholar everywhere Was nourish by the public care

JUPITER AND THE THUNDERBOLTS

Said Jupiter one day As on a cloud he lay all our crimes Come let us change the times By leasing out anew A world whose wicked crew Have wearied out our grace And cursed us to our face
Hie hellward Mercury A Fury bring to me The direst of the three
Race nursed too tenderly This day your doom shall be
while he spoke their fate His wrath began to moderate

O kings with whom His will Hath lodged our good and ill Your wrath and storm between One night should intervene

The god of rapid wing And lip unfaltering To sunless regions sped And met the sisters dread
To grim Tisiphone And pale Megaera he Preferr as murderess Alecto pitiless
This choice so roused the fiend By Pluto beard she swore The human race no more Should be by handfuls glean But in one solid mass Th infernal gates should pass
But Jove displeased with both The Fury and her oath Despatched her back to hell
And then a bolt he hurl Down on a faithless world Which in a desert fell
Aim by a father arm It caused more fear than harm
All fathers strike aside
What did from this betide
Our evil race grew bold Resumed their wicked tricks Increased them manifold Till all Olympus through Indignant murmurs flew
When swearing by the Styx The sire that rules the air Storms promised to prepare More terrible and dark Which should not miss their mark
father wrath it is
The other deities All in one voice exclaim might the thing be named Some other god would make Bolts better for our sake
This Vulcan undertook
His rumbling forges shook And glow with fervent heat While Cyclops blew and beat
Forth from the plastic flame Two sorts of bolts there came
Of these one misses not is by Olympus shot That is the gods at large
The other bearing wide Hits or side Or makes a cloud its targe
And this it is alone Which leaves the father throne


THE FALCON AND THE CAPON

You often hear a sweet seductive call If wise you haste towards it not at all And if you heed my apologue You act like John de Nivelle dog

A capon citizen of Mans Was summon from a throng To answer to the village squire Before tribunal call the fire
The matter to disguise The kitchen sheriff wise Cried Biddy Biddy But not a moment did he This Norman and a half The smooth official trust
bait said he dust And I too old for chaff
Meantime a falcon on his perch Observed the flight and search
In man by instinct or experience The capons have so little confidence That this was not without much trouble caught Though for a splendid supper sought
To lie the morrow night In brilliant Supinely on a dish viands fowl and fish With all the ease that heart could wish This honour from his master kind The fowl would gladly have declined
Outcried the bird of chase As in the weeds he eyed the skulker face what a stupid blockhead race Such witless brainless fools Might well defy the schools
For me I understand To chase at word The swiftest bird Aloft sea or land At slightest beck Returning quick To perch upon my master hand
There at his window he appears He waits thee hasten hast no ears

that I have the fowl replied what from master might betide
Or cook with cleaver at his side
Return you may for such a call But let me fly their fatal hall And spare your mirth at my expense I lack is not the sense To know that all this breath Is spent to lure me to my death
If you had seen upon the spit As many of the falcons roast As I have of the capon host You would not thus reproach my wit

THE CAT AND THE RAT

Four creatures wont to prowl Sly the cat Grave the owl Thief the rat And Madam Weasel prim and fine Inhabited a rotten pine
A man their home discover there And set one night a cunning snare
The cat a noted Went forth at break of day To hunt her usual prey
Not much the wiser For morning feeble ray The noose did suddenly surprise her
Waked by her strangling cry Grey drew nigh As full of joy was he As of despair was she For in the noose he saw His foe of mortal paw
friend said pray this cursed cord detach
I always known your skill And often your Now help me from this worst of snares In which I fell at unawares
is by a sacred right You sole of all your race By special love and grace Have been my favourite The darling of my eyes
was order by celestial cares No doubt I thank the blessed skies That going out to say my prayers As cats devout each morning do This net has made me pray to you
Come fall to work upon the cord
Replied the rat what reward Shall pay me if I dare
said the cat swear To be your firm ally Henceforth eternally These powerful claws are yours Which safe your life insures
I guard from quadruped and fowl I eat the weasel and the owl
cried the rat fool
I quite too wise to be your tool
He said and sought his snug retreat Close at the rotten feet
Where plump he did the weasel meet Whom shunning by a happy dodge He climb the hollow trunk to lodge And there the savage owl he saw
Necessity became his law And down he went the rope to gnaw
Strand after strand in two he bit And freed at last the hypocrite
That moment came the man in sight The new allies took hasty flight

A good while after that Our liberated cat Espied her favourite rat Quite out of reach and on his guard
friend said she take your shyness hard Your caution wrongs my gratitude Approach and greet your staunch ally
Do you suppose dear rat that I Forget the solemn oath I mew
I forget the rat replied what your nature is allied
To thankfulness or even pity Can cats be ever bound by treaty

Alliance from necessity Is safe just while it has to be

THE TORRENT AND THE RIVER

With mighty rush and roar Adown a mountain steep A torrent tumbled swelling Its rugged banks and bore Vast ruin in its sweep
The traveller were surely rash To brave its whirling foaming dash But one by robbers sorely press Its terrors haply put to test
They were but threats of foam and sound The loudest where the least profound
With courage from his safe success His foes continuing to press He met a river in his course On stole its waters calm and deep So silently they seem asleep All sweetly cradled as I ween In sloping banks and gravel clean They threaten neither man nor horse
Both ventured but the noble steed That saved from robbers by his speed From that deep water could not save Both went to drink the Stygian wave Both went to cross but not to swim Where reigns a monarch stern and grim Far other streams than ours

Still men are men of dangerous powers Elsewhere is only ignorance that cowers

EDUCATION

Lapluck and Caesar brothers were descended From dogs by Fame the most commended Who falling in their puppyhood To different masters anciently One dwelt and hunted in the boundless wood From thieves the other kept a kitchen free
At first each had another name But by their bringing up it came While one improved upon his nature The other grew a sordid creature Till by some scullion called Lapluck The name ungracious ever stuck
To high exploits his brother grew Put many a stag at bay and tore Full many a trophy from the boar In short him first of all his crew The world as Caesar knew And care was had lest by a baser mate His noble blood should degenerate
Not so with his neglected brother He made whatever came a mother And by the laws of population His race became a countless nation The common turnspits throughout France Where danger is they do advance Precisely the antipodes Of what we call the Caesars these

Oft falls the son below his sire estate Through want of care all things degenerate

THE TWO DOGS AND THE DEAD ASS

The Virtues should be sisters hand in hand Since banded brothers all the Vices stand When one of these our hearts attacks All come in file there only lacks From out the cluster here and there A mate of some antagonizing pair That ca agree the common roof to share
But all the Virtues as a sisterhood Have scarcely ever in one subject stood
We find one brave but passionate Another prudent but ingrate
Of beasts the dog may claim to be The pattern of fidelity But for our teaching little wiser He both a fool and gormandiser
For proof I cite two mastiffs that espied A dead ass floating on a water wide
The distance growing more and more Because the wind the carcass bore friend said one eyes are best Pray let them on the water rest What thing is that I seem to see
An ox or horse
what can it be

cried his mate matter which Provided we could get a flitch
It doubtless is our lawful prey The puzzle is to find some way To get the prize for wide the space To swim with wind against your face
Let drink the flood our thirsty throats Will gain the end as well as boats
The water swallow by and bye We have the carcass high and dry Enough to last a week at least
Both drank as some do at a feast Their breath was quench before their thirst And presently the creatures burst

And such is man
Whatever he May set his soul to do or be To him is possibility
How many vows he makes
How many steps he takes
How does he strive and pant and strain Fortune or Glory prize to gain
If round my farm off well I must Or fill my coffers with the dust Or master Hebrew science history I make my task to drink the sea
One spirit projects to fulfil Four bodies would require and still The work would stop half done The lives of four Methuselahs Placed end to end for use alas
Would not suffice the wants of one

DEMOCRITUS AND THE PEOPLE OF ABDERA

How do I hate the tide of vulgar thought
Profane unjust with childish folly fraught It breaks and bends the rays of truth divine And by its own conceptions measures mine
Famed Epicurus master tried The power of this unstable tide
His country said the sage was mad The simpletons
But why
No prophet ever honour had Beneath his native sky
Democritus in truth was wise The mass were mad with faith in lies
So far this error went That all Abdera sent To old Hippocrates To cure the sad disease
townsman said the messengers Appropriately shedding tears lost his wits
Democritus By study spoil is lost to us
Were he but fill with ignorance We should esteem him less a dunce
He saith that worlds like this exist An absolutely endless list And peopled even it may be With countless hosts as wise as we
But not contented with such dreams His brain with viewless atoms teems Instinct with deathless life it seems
And never stirring from the sod below He weighs and measures all the stars And while he knows the universe Himself he doth not know
Though now his lips he strictly bars He once delighted to converse
Come godlike mortal try thy art divine Where traits of worst insanity combine
Small faith the great physician lent But still perhaps more readily he went
And mark what meetings strange Chance causes in this world of change
Hippocrates arrived in season Just as his patient void of reason
Was searching whether reason home In talking animals and dumb Be in the head or in the heart Or in some other local part
All calmly seated in the shade Where brooks their softest music made He traced with study most insane The convolutions of a brain And at his feet lay many a scroll The works of sages on the soul
Indeed so much absorb was he His friend at first he did not see
A pair so admirably match Their compliments erelong despatch
In time and talk as well as dress The wise are frugal I confess
Dismissing trifles they began At once with eagerness to scan The life and soul and laws of man Nor stopp till they had travell all The ground from physical to moral
My time and space would fail To give the full detail

But I have said enough to show How little is the people know
How true then goes the saw abroad Their voice is but the voice of God

Democritus and Epicurus lived about a century apart
The latter was disciple to the former only because in early life he adopted some of Democritus philosophy
Later Epicurus rejected more than he accepted of what his master taught


THE WOLF AND THE HUNTER

Thou lust of gain foul fiend whose evil eyes Regard as nought the blessings of the skies Must I for ever battle thee in vain
How long demandest thou to gain The meaning of my lessons plain
Will constant getting never cloy
Will man slacken to enjoy
Haste friend thou hast not long to live Let me the precious word repeat And listen to it I entreat A richer lesson none can give The sovereign antidote for sorrow ENJOY will
But when Ah
death may take you on the way Why not enjoy I ask
Lest envious fate your hopes ingulf As once it served the hunter and the wolf

The former with his fatal bow A noble deer had laid full low A fawn approach and quickly lay Companion of the dead For side by side they bled
Could one have wished a richer prey
Such luck had been enough to sate A hunter wise and moderate
Meantime a boar as big as was taken Our archer tempted proud and fond of bacon
Another candidate for Styx Struck by his arrow foams and kicks
But strangely do the shears of Fate To cut his cable hesitate
Alive yet dying there he lies A glorious and a dangerous prize
And was not this enough
Not quite To fill a conqueror appetite For ere the boar was dead he spied A partridge by a furrow side A trifle to his other game
Once more his bow he drew The desperate boar upon him came And in his dying vengeance slew The partridge thank him as she flew

Thus much is to the covetous address The miserly shall have the rest

A wolf in passing saw that woeful sight
Fortune cried the savage with delight fane to thee I build outright
carcasses
how rich
But spare make them last such luck is rare The miser everlasting plea
last a month for let me see One two three four the weeks are four If I can count and some days more
Well two days hence And I commence
Meantime the string upon this bow I stint myself to eat For by its I know is made of entrails sweet
His entrails rued the fatal weapon Which while he heedlessly did step on The arrow pierced his bowels deep And laid him lifeless on the heap

Hark stingy souls
insatiate leeches
Our text this solemn duty teaches Enjoy the present do not wait To share the wolf or hunter fate

THE FAITHLESS DEPOSITARY

Thanks to Memory daughters nine Animals have graced my line Higher heroes in my story Might have won me less of glory
Wolves in language of the sky Talk with dogs throughout my verse Beasts with others shrewdly vie Representing characters Fools in furs not Sages hoof or feather stand Fewer truly are the latter More the former ay and fatter
Flourish also in my scene Tyrants villains mountebanks Beasts incapable of thanks Beasts of rash and reckless pranks Beasts of sly and flattering mien Troops of liars too I ween
As to men of every age All are liars saith the sage
Had he writ but of the low One could hardly think it so But that human mortals all Lie like serpents great and small Had another certified it I for one should have denied it
He who lies in Aesop way Or like Homer minstrel gray Is no liar sooth to say
Charms that bind us like a dream Offspring of their happy art Cloak in fiction more than seem Truth to offer to the heart
Both have left us works which I Think unworthy to die
Liar call not him who squares All his ends and aims with theirs But from sacred truth to vary Like the false depositary Is to be by every rule Both a liar and a fool
The story goes
A man of trade In Persia with his neighbour made Deposit as he left the state Of iron say a hundredweight
Return said he iron neighbour
iron
you have lost your labour I grieve to say it my soul A rat has eaten up the whole
My men were sharply scolded at But yet a hole in spite of that Was left as one is wont to be In every barn or granary By which crept in that cursed rat
Admiring much the novel thief The man affected full belief
Ere long his faithless neighbour child He stole away a heavy lad And then to supper bade the dad Who thus plead off in accents sad was but yesterday I had A boy as fine as ever smiled An only son as dear as life The darling of myself and wife
Alas
we have him now no more And every joy with us is
Replied the merchant By evening faint and dusky ray I saw a monstrous owl alight And bear your darling son away To yonder ruin gray
I believe you when you say An owl bore off so large a prey
How could it be
the father cried thing is surely quite absurd My son with ease had kill the bird
how of it the man replied not my province to decide I know I saw your son arise Borne through the air before my eyes
Why should it seem a strange affair Moreover in a country where A single rat contrives to eat A hundred pounds of iron meat That owls should be of strength to lift ye A booby boy that weighs but fifty
The other plainly saw the trick Restored the iron very quick
And got with shame as well as joy Possession of his kidnapp boy

The like occurr two travellers between
One was of those Who wear a microscope I ween Each side the nose
Would you believe their tales romantic Our Europe in its monsters beats The lands that feel the tropic heats Surcharged with all that is gigantic
This person feeling free To use the trope hyperbole Had seen a cabbage with his eyes Exceeding any house in size
I have seen the other cries Resolved to leave his fellow in the lurch pot that would have held a church
Why friend do give that doubting look The pot was made your cabbages to cook
This was a wit The too was wise
To such absurd and ultra lies Their answers were exactly fit
doing honour overmuch To reason or dispute with such
To overbid them is the shortest path And less provocative of wrath

Still if the season later were O wait the zephyrs hasten not Just now the raven on his oak In hoarser tones than usual spoke
My heart forebodes the saddest lot The falcons nets Alas it rains
My brother are thy wants supplied Provisions shelter And all that unto health pertains
These words occasion some demur In our imprudent traveller
But restless curiosity Prevail at last and so said he matter is not worth a sigh Three days at most will satisfy And then returning I shall tell You all the wonders that befell With scenes enchanting and sublime Shall sweeten all our coming time
Who seeth nought hath nought to say
My travel course from day to day Will be the source of great delight
A store of tales I shall relate Say there I lodged at such a date And saw there such and such a sight
You think it all occurr to On this both weeping bade adieu
Away the lonely wanderer A began to lower He sought as shelter from the shower The only tree that graced the plain Whose leaves ill turn the pelting rain
The sky once more serene above On flew our drench and dripping dove And dried his plumage as he could
Next on the borders of a wood He spied some scatter grains of wheat Which one he thought might safely eat For there another dove he He felt the snare around him draw
This wheat was but a treacherous bait To lure poor pigeons to their fate
The snare had been so long in use With beak and wings he struggled loose Some feathers perish while it stuck But what was worst in point of luck A hawk the cruellest of foes Perceived him clearly as he rose Off dragging like a runaway A piece of string
The bird of prey Had bound him in a moment more Much faster than he was before But from the clouds an eagle came And made the hawk himself his game
By war of robbers profiting The dove for safety plied the wing And lighting on a ruin wall Believed his dangers ended all
A roguish boy had there a sling Age pitiless
We must confess And by a most unlucky fling Half kill our hapless dove Who now no more in love With foreign travelling And lame in leg and wing Straight homeward urged his crippled flight Fatigued but glad arrived at night In truly sad and piteous plight
The doves rejoin I leave you all to say What pleasure might their pains repay
Ah happy lovers would you roam Pray let it not be far from home
To each the other ought to be A world of beauty ever new In each the other ought to see The whole of what is good and true

Myself have loved nor would I then For all the wealth of crownèd men Or arch celestial paved with gold The presence of those woods have sold And fields and banks and hillocks which Were by the joyful steps made rich And smiled beneath the charming eyes Of her who made my heart a prize To whom I pledged it nothing loath And seal the pledge with virgin oath
Ah when will time such moments bring again
To me are sweet and charming objects vain My soul forsaking to its restless mood
O did my wither heart but dare To kindle for the bright and good Should not I find the charm still there
Is love to me with things that were

THE MONKEY AND THE LEOPARD

A monkey and a leopard were The rivals at a country fair
Each advertised his own attractions
Said one sirs the highest place My merit knows for of his grace The king hath seen me face to face And judging by his looks and actions I gave the best of satisfactions
When I am dead is plain enough My skin will make his royal muff
So richly is it streak and spotted So delicately waved and dotted Its various beauty can not fail to please
And thus invited everybody sees But soon they see and soon depart
The monkey to the mart His merits thus sets forth the while All in his own peculiar style gentlemen I pray you come In magic arts I am at home
The whole variety in which My neighbour boasts himself so rich Is to his simple skin confined While mine is living in the mind
Your humble servant Monsieur Gille The to Tickleville Pope monkey and of great renown Is now just freshly come to town Arrived in three bateaux express Your worships to address For he can speak you understand Can dance and practise Can jump through hoops and balance sticks In short can do a thousand tricks And all for blancos six Not messieurs for a sou
And if you think the price wo do When you have seen then he restore Each man his money at the door

The ape was not to reason blind For who in wealth of dress can find Such charms as dwell in wealth of mind
One meets our desires The other in a moment tires

Alas
how many lords there are Of mighty sway and lofty mien Who like this leopard at the fair Show all their talents on the skin

The blanc was a French copper coin six of which were equivalent in value to something over a penny of the present English money


THE ACORN AND THE PUMPKIN

God works are good
This truth to prove Around the world I need not move I do it by the nearest pumpkin
fruit so large on vine so small Surveying once exclaim a bumpkin could He mean who made us all
He left this pumpkin out of place
If I had order in the case Upon that oak it should have hung A noble fruit as ever swung To grace a tree so firm and strong
Indeed it was a great mistake As this discovery teaches That I myself did not partake His counsels whom my curate preaches
All things had then in order come This acorn for example Not bigger than my thumb Had not disgraced a tree so ample
The more I think the more I wonder To see outraged proportion laws And that without the slightest cause God surely made an awkward blunder
With such reflections proudly fraught Our sage grew tired of mighty thought And threw himself on Nature lap Beneath an oak to take his nap
Plump on his nose by lucky hap An acorn fell he waked and in The matted beard that graced his chin He found the cause of such a bruise As made him different language use

O
he cried bleed
I bleed
And this is what has done the deed
But truly what had been my fate Had this had half a pumpkin weight
I see that God had reasons good And all his works well understood
Thus home he went in humbler mood

This fable was much admired by Madame de Sévigné

THE SCHOOLBOY THE PEDANT AND THE OWNER OF A GARDEN

A boy who savour of his school A double rogue and double fool By youth and by the privilege Which pedants have by ancient right To alter reason and abridge A neighbour robb with fingers light Of flowers and fruit
This neighbour had Of fruits that make the autumn glad The very best and none but he
Each season brought from plant and tree To him its tribute for in spring His was the brightest blossoming
One day he saw our hopeful lad Perch on the finest tree he had Not only stuffing down the fruit But spoiling like a Vandal brute The buds that play Of plenty in the coming year
The branches too he rudely tore And carried things to such a pass The owner sent his servant To tell the master of his class
The latter came and came attended By all the urchins of his school And thus one plunderer mischief mended By pouring in an
It seems the pedant was intent On making public punishment To teach his boys the force of law And strike their roguish hearts with awe
The use of which he first must show From Virgil and from Cicero And many other ancients noted From whom in their own tongues he quoted
So long indeed his lecture lasted While not a single urchin fasted That ere its close their thievish crimes Were multiplied a hundred times

I hate all eloquence and reason Expended plainly out of season
Of all the beasts that earth have cursed While they have fed o The strikes me as the worst Except the pedant
The better of these neighbours two For me I sure would never do


THE SCULPTOR AND THE STATUE OF JUPITER

A block of marble was so fine To buy it did a sculptor hasten
shall my chisel now is mine A god a table or a basin

god said he thing shall be I arm it too with thunder
Let people quake and bow the knee With reverential wonder

So well the cunning artist wrought All things within a mortal reach That soon the marble wanted nought Of being Jupiter but speech

Indeed the man whose skill did make Had scarcely laid his chisel down Before himself began to quake And fear his manufacture frown

And even this excess of faith The poet once scarce fell behind The hatred fearing and the wrath Of gods the product of his mind

This trait we see in infancy Between the baby and its doll Of wax or china it may be A pocket stuff or folded shawl

Imagination rules the heart And here we find the fountain head From whence the pagan errors start That the teeming nations spread

With violent and flaming zeal Each takes his own chimera part Pygmalion doth a passion feel For Venus chisel by his art

All men as far as in them lies Create realities of dreams
To truth our nature proves but ice To falsehood fire it seems

The poet here takes an erroneous view of the story of Pygmalion
That sculptor fell in love with his statue of the nymph Galatea to which Venus gave life at his request

THE MOUSE METAMORPHOSED INTO A MAID

A mouse once from an owl beak fell I not have pick it up I wis A Brahmin did it very well Each country has its prejudice
The mouse indeed was sadly bruised
Although as neighbours we are used To be more kind to many others The Brahmins treat the mice as brothers
The notion haunts their heads that when The soul goes forth from dying men It enters worm or bird or beast As Providence or Fate is pleased And on this mystery rests their law Which from Pythagoras they said to draw
And hence the Brahmin kindly pray To one who knew the wizard trade To give the creature wounded sore The form in which it lodged before
Forthwith the mouse became a maid Of years about fifteen A lovelier was never seen
She would have waked I ween In Priam son a fiercer flame Than did the beauteous Grecian dame
Surprised at such a novelty The Brahmin to the damsel cried choice is free For every he Will seek you for his bride
Said she I to have a voice
The strongest then shall be my choice
sun
the Brahmin cried maid is thine And thou shalt be a of mine
said the sun murky cloud it seems In strength exceeds me since he hides my beams And him I counsel you to take
Again the reverend Brahmin spake cloud with thy stores of water Pray wast thou born to wed my daughter
no alas
for you may see The wind is far too strong for me
My claims with Boreas to compare I must confess I do not dare
wind then cried the Brahmin vex And wondering what would hinder next and with thy sweetest air Embrace possess the fairest fair
The wind enraptured thither blew A mountain stopp him as he flew To him now pass the And from him to a creature small
Said he wed the maid but that I had a quarrel with the rat
A fool were I to take the bride From one so sure to pierce my side
The rat
It thrill the damsel ear To name at once seem sweet and dear
The rat
was one of Cupid blows The like full many a maiden knows But all of this beneath the rose

One smacketh ever of the place Where first he show the world his face
Thus far the fable clear as light But if we take a nearer sight There lurks within its drapery Somewhat of graceless sophistry For who that worships the glorious sun Would not prefer to wed some cooler one
And doth a flea exceed a giant might Because the former can the latter bite
And by the rule of strength the rat Had sent his bride to wed the cat From cat to dog and onward still To wolf or tiger if you will Indeed the fabulist might run A circle backward to the But to the change the tale supposes In learned phrase metempsychosis
The very thing the wizard did Its falsity exposes If that indeed were ever hid
According to the Brahmin plan The proud aspiring soul of man And souls that dwell in humbler forms Of rats and mice and even worms All issue from a common source And hence they are the same of Unequal but by accident Of organ and of tenement They use one pair of legs or two Or with none contrive to do As tyrant matter binds them to
Why then could not so fine a frame Constrain its heavenly guest To wed the solar flame
A rat her love possess

In all respects compared and weigh The souls of men and souls of mice Quite different are made Unlike in sort as well as size
Each fits and fills its destined part As Heaven doth well provide Nor witch nor fiend nor magic art Can set their laws aside

THE FOOL WHO SOLD WISDOM

Of fools come never in the reach No rule can I more wisely teach
Nor can there be a better one Than this distemper heads to shun
We often see them high and low
They tickle the royal ear As privileged and free from fear They hurl about them joke and jeer At pompous lord or silly beau

A fool in town did wisdom cry The people eager flock to buy
Each for his money got Paid promptly on the spot Besides a box upon the head Two fathoms length of thread
The most were vex but quite in vain The public only mock their pain
The wiser they who nothing said But pocketed the box and thread
To search the meaning of the thing Would only laughs and hisses bring
Hath reason ever guaranteed The wit of fools in speech or deed
is said of brainless heads in France The cause of what they do is chance
One dupe however needs must know What meant the thread and what the blow So ask a sage to make it sure
both hieroglyphics pure The sage replied without delay people well advised will stay From fools this fibre length away Or get I hold it sure as fate The other symbol on the pate
So far from cheating you of gold The fool this wisdom fairly sold

THE OYSTER AND THE LITIGANTS

Two pilgrims on the sand espied An oyster thrown up by the tide
In hope both swallow ocean fruit But ere the fact there came dispute
While one stoop down to take the prey The other push him quite away
Said he rather meet To settle which shall eat
Why he who first the oyster saw Should be its eater by the law The other should but see him do it
Replied his mate thus you view it Thank God the lucky eye is mine
I an eye not worse than thine The other cried will be cursed If too I did see it first
saw it did you
Grant it true I saw it then and felt it too
Amidst this sweet affair Arrived a person very big Ycleped Sir Nincom Periwig
They made him judge to set the matter square
Sir Nincom with a solemn face Took up the oyster and the case In opening both the first he swallow And in due time his judgment follow
the court awards you each a shell Cost free depart in peace and use them well
Foot up the cost of suits at law The leavings reckon and awards The cash you see Sir Nincom draw And leave the parties purse and cards

Nincom The name in La Fontaine is Perrin Dandin which is also that of the peasant judge in Rabelais Book ch
and the judge in Racine Plaideurs produced in
Molière George Dandin produced may also have helped La Fontaine to the name
The character is a farmer but like the others he is a species of incapable and the word dandin in the old French dictionaries is given as signifying inaptness or incapacity

THE WOLF AND THE LEAN DOG

A troutling some time since Endeavour vainly to convince A hungry fisherman Of his unfitness for the
That controversy made it plain That letting go a good secure In hope of future gain Is but imprudence pure
The fisherman had reason good The troutling did the best he could Both argued for their lives
Now if my present purpose thrives I prop my former proposition By building on a small addition
A certain wolf in point of wit The prudent fisher opposite A dog once finding far astray Prepared to take him as his prey
The dog his leanness pled lordship sure he said Can not be very eager To eat a dog so meagre
To wait a little do not grudge The wedding of my master only daughter Will cause of fatted calves and fowls a slaughter And then as you yourself can judge I can not help becoming fatter
The wolf believing waived the matter And so some days therefrom Return with sole design to see If fat enough his dog might be
The rogue was now at home He saw the hunter through the fence
friend said he wait I be with you a moment hence And fetch our porter of the gate
This porter was a dog immense That left to wolves no future tense
Suspicion gave our wolf a jog It might not be so safely tamper
service to your porter dog Was his reply as off he scamper
His legs proved better than his head And saved him life to learn his trade

NOTHING TOO MUCH

Look where we will throughout creation We look in vain for moderation
There is a certain golden mean Which Nature sovereign Lord I ween Design the path of all forever
Doth one pursue it
Never
things which by their nature bless Are turn to curses by excess

The grain best gift of Ceres fair Green waving in the genial air By overgrowth exhausts the soil By superfluity of leaves Defrauds the treasure of its sheaves And mocks the busy farmer toil
Not less redundant is the tree So sweet a thing is luxury
The grain within due bounds to keep Their Maker licenses the sheep The leaves excessive to retrench
In troops they spread across the plain And nibbling down the hapless grain Contrive to spoil it root and branch
So then with licence from on high The wolves are sent on sheep to prey The whole the greedy gluttons slay Or if they do they try

Next men are sent on wolves to take The vengeance now condign In turn the same abuse they make Of this behest divine

Of animals the human kind Are to excess the most inclined
On low and high we make the charge Indeed upon the race at large
There liveth not the soul select That sinneth not in this respect
Of Nought too much the fact is All preach the truth none practise

From bowers of gods the bees came down to man
On Mount Hymettus first they say They made their home and stored away The treasures which the zephyrs fan

JUPITER AND THE PASSENGER

How danger would the gods enrich If we the vows remember which It drives us to
But danger past Kind Providence is paid the last
No earthly debt is treated so
Jove the wretch exclaims wait He sends no sheriff to one gate Like creditors below But let me ask the dolt What means the thunderbolt

A passenger endanger by the sea Had vow a hundred oxen good To him who quell old Terra brood
He had not one as well might he Have vow a hundred elephants
Arrived on shore his good intents Were dwindled to the smoke which rose An offering merely for the nose From half a dozen beefless bones
Jove said he my vow
The fumes of beef thou breathest now Are all thy godship ever owns From debt I therefore stand acquitted
With seeming smile the god submitted But not long after caught him well By sending him a dream to tell Of treasure hid
Off ran the liar As if to quench a house on fire And on a band of robbers fell
As but a crown he had that day He promised them of sterling gold A hundred talents truly told Directing where conceal they lay In such a village on their way
The rogues so much the tale suspected Said one we should suffer you to You cheaply get us all detected Go then and bear your gold to Pluto

THE CAT AND THE FOX

The cat and fox when saints were all the rage Together went on pilgrimage
Arch hypocrites and swindlers they By sleight of face and sleight of paw Regardless both of right and law Contrived expenses to repay By eating many a fowl and cheese And other tricks as bad as these
Disputing served them to beguile The road of many a weary mile
Disputing
but for this resort The world would go to sleep in short
Our pilgrims as a thing of course Disputed till their throats were hoarse
Then dropping to a lower tone They talk of this and talk of that Till Renard whisper to the cat think yourself a knowing one How many cunning tricks have you
For I a hundred old and new All ready in my haversack
The cat replied do not lack Though with but one provided And truth to honour for that matter I hold it than a thousand better
In fresh dispute they sided And loudly were they at it when Approach a mob of dogs and men
said the cat tricks ransack And put your cunning brains to rack One life to save I show you mine A trick you see for saving nine
With that she climb a lofty pine
The fox his hundred ruses tried And yet no safety found
A hundred times he falsified The nose of every Was here and there and everywhere Above and under ground But yet to stop he did not dare Pent in a hole it was no joke To meet the terriers or the smoke
So leaping into upper air He met two dogs that choked him there

Expedients may be too many Consuming time to choose and try
On one but that as good as any is best in danger to rely


THE HUSBAND THE WIFE AND THE THIEF

A man that loved and loved his wife Still led an almost joyless life
No tender look nor gracious word Nor smile that coming from a bride Its object would have deified told her doting lord The love with which he burn Was in its kind return
Still unrepining at his lot This man thus tied in Hymen knot Thank God for all the good he got
But why
If love doth fail to season Whatever pleasures Hymen gives I sure I can not see the reason Why one for him the happier lives
However since his wife Had caress him in her life He made complaint of it one night
The entrance of a thief Cut short his tale of grief And gave the lady such a fright She shrunk from dreaded harms Within her husband arms
thief cried he joy so sweet I owe to thee Now take as thy reward Of all that owns me lord Whatever suits thee save my spouse Ay if thou pleasest take the house
As thieves are not remarkably with modesty This fellow made quite free

From this account it doth appear The passions all are ruled by fear
Aversion may be conquer by it And even love may not defy it
But still some cases there have been Where love hath ruled the roast I ween
That lover witness highly bred Who burnt his house above his head And all to clasp a certain dame And bear her harmless through the flame
This transport through the fire I own I much admire And for a Spanish soul reputed coolish I think it grander even than was foolish

THE TREASURE AND THE TWO MEN

A man whose credit fail and what was worse Who lodged the devil in his purse That is to say lodged nothing there By in the air Concluded his accounts to square Since should he not he understood From various tokens famine would A death for which no mortal wight Had ever any appetite
A ruin crown with ivy green Was of his tragedy the scene
His hangman noose he duly tied And then to drive a nail he tried But by his blows the wall gave way Now tremulous and old Disclosing to the light of day A sum of hidden gold
He clutch it up and left Despair To struggle with his halter there
Nor did the much delighted man stop to count it as he ran
But while he went the owner came Who loved it with a secret flame Too much indeed for kissing And found his money missing
Heavens
he cried I Such riches lose and still not die
Shall I not hang as I in fact Might justly do if cord I lack But now without expense I can This cord here only lacks a man
The saving was no saving clause It suffer not his heart to falter Until it reach his final pause As full possessor of the halter is thus the miser often grieves the benefit receives Of what he owns he never must Mere treasurer for thieves Or relatives or dust
But what say we about the trade In this affair by Fortune made
Why what but that it was just like her
In freaks like this delighteth she
The shorter any turn may be The better it is sure to strike her
It fills that goddess full of glee A man to see And that it does especially When made so unexpectedly

The story of this fable has been traced to the Epigrams of Ausonius who was born at Bordeaux and lived in the fourth century


THE MONKEY AND THE CAT

Sly Bertrand and Ratto in company sat The one was a monkey the other a cat and lodgers More mischievous codgers mess from a platter since platters were flat
Was anything wrong in the house or about it The neighbours were blameless no mortal could doubt it For Bertrand was thievish and Ratto so nice More attentive to cheese than he was to the mice
One day the two plunderers sat by the fire Where chestnuts were roasting with looks of desire
To steal them would be a right noble affair
A double inducement our heroes drew there benefit them could they swallow their fill And then occasion to somebody Said Bertrand to Ratto brother Exhibit your powers in a masterly way And take me these chestnuts I pray
Which were I but otherwise fitted As I am ingeniously witted For pulling things out of the flame Would stand but a pitiful game
done replied Ratto all prompt to obey And thrust out his paw in a delicate way
First giving the ashes a scratch He open the coveted batch Then lightly and quickly impinging He drew out in spite of the singeing One after another the chestnuts at last While Bertrand contrived to devour them as fast
A servant girl enters
Adieu to the fun
Our Ratto was hardly contented says
No more are the princes by flattery paid For furnishing help in a different trade And burning their fingers to bring More power to some mightier king

My pipe and even step he knew To meet me when I came he flew In shade we napp together Alas alas my Robin Wether
When Willy thus had duly said His eulogy upon the dead And unto everlasting fame Consign poor Robin Wether name He then harangued the flock at large From proud old chieftain rams Down to the smallest lambs Addressing them this weighty charge Against the wolf as one to stand In firm united fearless band By which they might expel him from their land
Upon their faith they would not flinch They promised him a single inch
choke said they murderous glutton Who robbed of us of our Robin Mutton
Their lives they pledged against the beast And Willy gave them all a feast
But evil Fate than Phoebus faster Ere night had brought a new disaster A wolf there came
By nature law The total flock were prompt to run And yet was not the wolf they saw But shadow of him from the setting sun

Harangue a craven soldiery What heroes they will seem to be

THE TWO RATS THE FOX AND THE EGG

Address to Madame de la Sablière

You Iris an easy task to praise But you refuse the incense of my lays
In this you are unlike all other mortals Who welcome all the praise that seeks their portals Not one who is not soothed by sound so sweet
For me to blame this humour were not meet By gods and mortals shared in common And in the main by lovely woman
That drink so vaunted by the rhyming trade That cheers the god who deals the And oft intoxicates the gods below The nectar Iris is of praises made
You taste it not
But in its place Wit science even trifles grace Your bill of fare but for that matter The world will not believe the latter
Well leave the world in unbelief
Still science trifles fancies light as air I hold should mingle in a bill of fare Each giving each its due relief As where the gifts of Flora fall On different flowers we see Alight the busy bee Educing sweet from all
Thus much premised do think it strange Or aught beyond my muse range If my fables should infold Among their nameless trumpery The traits of a philosophy as subtle charming bold
They call it new the men of wit Perhaps you have not heard of it
My verse will tell you what it means They say that beasts are mere machines That in their doings everything Is done by virtue of a spring No sense no soul nor notion But matter merely set in motion Just such the watch in kind Which joggeth on to purpose blind
Now ope and read within its breast The place of soul is by its wheels possess
One moves a second that a third Till finally its sound is heard
And now the beast our sages say Is moved precisely in this way An object strikes it in a certain place The spot thus struck without a moment space To neighbouring parts the news conveys Thus sense receives it through the chain And takes How
Not I
They say by sheer necessity From will as well as passion free The animal is found the thrall Of movements which the vulgar call Joy sadness pleasure pain and love The cause extrinsic and Believe it not
What this I hold
Why sooth it is a watch of gold Its life the mere unbending of a spring
And we are quite a different thing
Hear how Descartes Descartes whom all applaud Whom pagans would have made a god Who holds in fact the middle place ours and the celestial race About as does the plodding ass From man to oyster as you pass Hear how this author states the case all the tribes to being brought By our Creator out of nought I only have the gift of thought
Now Iris you will recollect We were by older science taught That when brutes think they do reflect
Descartes proceeds beyond the wall And says they do not think at all
This you believe with ease And so could I if I should please
Still in the forest when from morn Till midday sounds of dog and horn Have terrified the stag forlorn When he has doubled forth and back And labour to confound his track Till tired and spent with efforts vain An ancient stag of antlers ten He puts a younger in his place All fresh to weary out the What thoughts for one that merely grazes
The doublings turnings windings mazes The substituting fresher bait Were worthy of a man of state And worthy of a better fate
To yield to rascal dogs his breath Is all the honour of his death
And when the partridge danger spies Before her brood have strength to rise She wisely counterfeits a wound And drags her wing upon the ground Thus from her home beside some ancient log Safe drawing off the sportsman and his dog And while the latter seems to seize her The victim of an easy chase teeth are not for such as me sir She cries And flies And laughs the former in his face

Far north is said the people live In customs nearly primitive That is to say are bound In ignorance profound I mean the people human For animals are dwelling there With skill such buildings to prepare As could on earth but few men
Firm laid across the torrent course Their work withstands its mighty force So damming it from shore to shore That gliding smoothly In even sheets the waters pour
Their work as it proceeds they grade and bevel Or bring it up to plumb or level First lay their logs and then with mortar smear As if directed by an engineer
Each labours for the public good The old command the youthful brood Cut down and shape and place the wood
Compared with theirs Plato model state Were but the work of some apprentice pate
Such are the beaver folks who know Enough to house themselves from snow And bridge though they can swim the pools
Meanwhile our kinsmen are such fools In spite of their example They dwell in huts less ample And cross the streams by swimming However cold and brimming
Now that the skilful beaver Is but a body void of spirit From whomsoever I might hear it I would believe it never

But I go farther in the case
Pray listen while I tell A thing which lately fell From one of truly royal race
A prince beloved by Victory The North defender here shall be My voucher and your guaranty Whose mighty name alone Commands the sultan throne The king whom Poland calls her own
This king declares kings can not lie we hear That on his own frontier Some animals there are Engaged in ceaseless war From age to age the quarrel runs Transmitted down from sires to sons These beasts he says are to the fox akin And with more skill no war hath been By highest military powers Conducted in this age of ours Guards piquets scouts and spies And ambuscade that hidden lies The foe to capture by surprise And many a shrewd appliance Of that pernicious cursed science The daughter of the Stygian wave And mother harsh of heroes brave Those military creatures have
To chant their feats a bard we lack Till Death shall give us Homer back
And should he such a wonder do And while his hand was in release Old Epicurus rival too What would the latter say to facts like these
Why as I said that nature does such things In animals by means of springs That Memory is but corporeal And that to do the things array So proudly in my story all The animal but needs her aid
At each return the object so to speak Proceeds directly to her store With keenest optics there to seek The image it had traced before Which found proceeds forthwith to act Just as at first it did in fact By neither thought nor reason back
Not so with us beasts perpendicular With us kind Heaven is more particular
by independent mind We not the sport of objects blind Nor to instinct are consign
I walk I talk I feel the sway Of power within This nice machine It can not but obey
This power although with matter link Is comprehended as distinct
Indeed is comprehended better In truth and essence than is matter
all our arts it is supreme
But how doth matter understand Or hear its sovereign lord command
Here doth a difficulty seem I see the tool obey the hand But then the hand who guideth it Who guides the stars in order fit
Perhaps each mighty world Since from its Maker hurl Some angel may have kept in custody
However that may be A spirit dwells in such as we It moves our limbs we feel its mandates now We see and know it rules but know not how Nor shall we know indeed Till in the breast of God we read
And speaking in all verity Descartes is just as ignorant as we In things beyond a mortal ken He knows no more than other men
But Iris I confess to this That in the beasts of which I speak Such spirit it were vain to seek For man its only temple is
Yet beasts must have a place Beneath our godlike race Which no mere plant requires Although the plant respires

But what shall one reply To what I next shall certify
Two rats in foraging fell on an egg For gentry such as they A genteel dinner every way They needed not to find an ox leg
Brimful of joy and appetite They were about to sack the box So tight without the aid of locks When suddenly there came in sight A personage Sir Pullet Fox
Sure luck was never more untoward Since Fortune was a vixen froward
How should they save their egg and bacon
Their plunder could then be bagg Should it in forward paws be taken Or roll along or dragg
Each method seem impossible And each was then of danger full
Necessity ingenious mother Brought forth what help them from their pother
As still there was a chance to save their prey The spunger yet some hundred yards away One seized the egg and turn upon his back And then in spite of many a thump and thwack That would have torn perhaps a coat of mail The other dragg him by the tail
Who dares the inference to blink That beasts possess wherewith to think

Were I commission to bestow This power on creatures here below The beasts should have as much of mind As infants of the human kind
Think not the latter from their birth
It hence appears there are on earth That have the simple power of thought Where reason hath no knowledge wrought
And on this wise an equal power I yield To all the various tenants of the field Not reason such as in ourselves we find But something more than any mainspring blind
A speck of matter I would subtilise Almost beyond the reach of mental eyes An atom essence one might say An extract of a solar ray More quick and pungent than a flame of fire For if of flame the wood is sire Can not the flame itself refined Give some idea of the mind
Comes not the purest gold From lead as we are told
To feel and choose my work should soar Unthinking judgment nothing more
No monkey of my manufacture Should argue from his sense or fact sure But my allotment to mankind Should be of very different mind
We men should share in double measure Or rather have a twofold treasure The one the soul the same in all That bear the name of animal The sages dunces great and small That tenant this our teeming ball The other still another soul Which should to mortals here belong In common with the angel throng Which made an independent whole Could pierce the skies to worlds of light Within a point have room to be Its life a morn sans noon or night
Exempt from all destructive change A thing as real as it is strange
In infancy this child of day Should glimmer but a feeble ray
Its earthly organs stronger grown The beam of reason brightly thrown Should pierce the darkness thick and gross That holds the other prison close

THE MAN AND THE ADDER

villain
cried a man who found An adder coil upon the ground do a very grateful deed For all the world I shall proceed
On this the animal perverse I mean the snake Pray do mistake The human for the worse Was caught and bagg and worst of all His blood was by his captor to be spilt Without regard to innocence or guilt
to show the why these words let fall His judge and jailor proud and tall type of all ingratitude
All charity to hearts like thine Is folly certain to be rued
Die then Thou foe of men
Thy temper and thy teeth malign Shall never hurt a hair of mine
The muffled serpent on his side The best a serpent could replied all this world ingrates Must meet with such a death Who from this worst of fates Could save his breath
Upon thyself thy law recoils I throw myself upon thy broils Thy graceless revelling on spoils If thou but homeward cast an eye Thy deeds all mine will justify
But strike my life is in thy hand Thy justice all may understand Is but thy interest pleasure or caprice Pronounce my sentence on such laws as these
But give me leave to tell thee while I can The type of all ingratitude is man
By such a lecture somewhat foil The other back a step recoil And finally replied reasons are abusive And wholly inconclusive
I might the case decide Because to me such right belongs But let refer the case of wrongs
The snake agreed they to a cow referr it
Who being called came graciously and heard it
Then summing up need said she such a case to call on me
The adder right plain truth to bellow For years I nursed this haughty fellow Who but for me had long ago Been lodging with the shades below
For him my milk has had to flow My calves at tender age to die
And for this best of wealth And often reëstablished health What pay or even thanks have I
Here feeble old and worn alas
I left without a bite of grass
Were I but left it might be weather But shame to say it I am tether
And now my fate is surely sadder Than if my master were an adder With brains within the latitude Of such immense ingratitude
This gentles is my honest view And so I bid you both adieu
The man confounded and astonish To be so faithfully admonish Replied fools to listen now To this old silly dotard cow
Let trust the ox
trust replied The crawling beast well gratified
So said so done The ox with tardy pace came on And ruminating the case Declared with very serious face That years of his most painful toil Had clothed with Ceres gifts our soil Her gifts to men but always sold To beasts for higher cost than gold And that for this for his reward More blows than thanks return his lord And then when age had chill his blood And men would quell the wrath of Heaven Out must be pour the vital flood For others sins all thankless given
So spake the ox and then the man with such a dull declaimer
Instead of judge it is his plan To play accuser and defamer
A tree was next the arbitrator And made the wrong of man still greater
It served as refuge from the heat The showers and storms which madly beat It grew our gardens greatest pride Its shadow spreading far and wide And bow itself with fruit beside But yet a mercenary clown With cruel iron chopp it down
Behold the recompense for which Year after year it did enrich With spring sweet flowers and autumn fruits And summer shade both men and brutes And warm the hearth with many a limb Which winter from its top did trim
Why could not man have pruned and spared And with itself for ages shared Much scorning thus to be convinced The man resolved his cause to gain
Quoth he goodness is evinced By hearing this is very plain Then flung the serpent bag and all With fatal force against a wall

So ever is it with the great With whom the whim doth always run That Heaven all creatures doth create For their behoof beneath the sun Count they four feet or two or none
If one should dare the fact dispute He straight set down a stupid brute
Now grant it so such lords among What should be done or said or sung
At distance speak or hold your tongue

THE TORTOISE AND THE TWO DUCKS

A tortoise anciently Tired of her hole the world would see
Prone are all such to roam Prone are all cripples to abhor their home
Two ducks to whom the gossip told The secret of her purpose bold Profess to have the means whereby They could her wishes gratify
boundless road said they
It is the open air And through it we will bear You safe land and ocean
Republics kingdoms you will view And famous cities old and new And get of customs laws a notion Of various wisdom various pieces As did indeed the sage Ulysses
The eager tortoise waited not To question what Ulysses got But closed the bargain on the spot
A nice machine the birds devise To bear their pilgrim through the Athwart her mouth a stick they throw bite it hard and do let go They say and seize each duck an end And swiftly flying upward tend
It made the people gape and stare Beyond the expressive power of words To see a tortoise cut the air Exactly poised between two birds
miracle they cried seen
There goes the flying tortoise queen
queen
was thus the tortoise spoke truly that without a joke
Much better had she held her tongue For opening that whereby she clung Before the gazing crowd she fell And dash to bits her brittle shell

Imprudence vanity and babble And idle curiosity An rabble Have all the same paternity

THE FISHES AND THE CORMORANT

No pond nor pool within his haunt But paid a certain cormorant Its contribution from its fishes And stock his kitchen with good dishes
Yet when old age the bird had chill His kitchen was less amply fill
All cormorants however grey Must die or for themselves purvey
But ours had now become so blind His finny prey he could not find And having neither hook nor net His appetite was poorly met
What hope with famine thus infested
Necessity whom history mentions A famous mother of inventions The following stratagem suggested He found upon the water brink A crab to which said he friend A weighty errand let me send Go quicker than a wink Down to the fishes sink And tell them they are doom to die For ere eight days have hasten by Its lord will fish this water dry
The crab as fast as she could scrabble Went down and told the scaly rabble
What bustling gathering agitation
Straight up they send a deputation To wait upon the ancient bird
Cormorant whence hast thou heard This dreadful news
And what Assurance of it hast thou got
How such a danger can we shun
Pray tell us what is to be done
change your said he change our dwelling
How can we
by your leave I take that care And one by one in safety bear You all to my retreat The path unknown To any feet Except my own
A pool scoop out by Nature hands Amidst the desert rocks and sands Where human traitors never come Shall save your people from their doom
The fish republic swallow all And coming at the fellow call Were singly borne away to stock A pond beneath a lonely rock And there good prophet cormorant Proprietor and bailiff sole From narrow water clear and shoal With ease supplied his daily want And taught them at their own expense That heads well stored with common sense Give no devourers Still did the change not hurt their case Since had they staid the human race Successful by pernicious art Would have consumed as large a part
What matters who your flesh devours Of human or of bestial powers
In this respect or wild or tame All stomachs seem to me the same The odds is small in point of sorrow Of death or death

THE BURIER AND HIS COMRADE

A had his money hoarded Beyond the room his till afforded
His avarice aye growing ranker Whereby his mind of course grew blanker He was perplex to choose a banker For banker he must have he thought Or all his heap would come to nought
fear said he kept at home And other robbers should not come It might be equal cause of grief That I had proved myself the thief
The thief
Is to enjoy one pelf To rob or steal it from one self
My friend could but my pity reach you This lesson I would gladly teach you That wealth is weal no longer than Diffuse and part with it you can Without that power it is a woe
Would you for age keep back its flow
Age buried its joyless snow
With pains of getting care of got Consumes the value every jot Of gold that one can never spare
To take the load of such a care Assistants were not very rare
The earth was that which pleased him best
Dismissing thought of all the rest He with his friend his trustiest A sort of Went forth his hoard to bury
Safe done a few days afterward The man must look beneath the sward When what a mystery
behold The mine exhausted of its gold
Suspecting with the best of cause His friend was privy to his loss He bade him in a cautious mood To come as soon as well he could For still some other coins he had Which to the rest he wish to add
Expecting thus to get the whole The friend put back the sum he stole Then came with all despatch
The other proved an overmatch Resolved at length to save by spending His practice thus most wisely mending The total treasure home he carried No longer hoarded it or buried
Chapfallen was the thief when gone He saw his prospects and his pawn

From this it may be stated That knaves with ease are cheated

THE WOLF AND THE SHEPHERDS

A Wolf replete With humanity sweet A trait not much suspected On his cruel deeds The fruit of his needs Profoundly thus reflected

hated said he joint enemy By hunters dogs and clowns
They swear I shall die And their hue and cry The very thunder drowns

brethren have fled With price on the head From England merry land
King Edgar came out And put them to rout With many a deadly band

there not a squire But blows up the fire By hostile proclamation Nor a human brat Dares cry but that Its mother mocks my nation

all for what
For a sheep with the rot Or scabby mangy ass Or some snarling cur With less meat than fur On which I broken fast

henceforth I strive That nothing alive Shall die to quench my thirst No lambkin shall fall Nor puppy at all To glut my maw accurst
With grass I appease Or browse on the trees Or die of famine first

of carcass warm
Is it worth the storm Of universal hate
As he spoke these words The lords of the herds All seated at their bait He saw and observed The meat which was served Was nought but roasted lamb

O
said the beast of my feast All butcher as I am On these vermin mean Whose guardians Eat at a rate quadruple Themselves and their dogs As greedy as hogs And I a wolf to scruple

out for your wool I not be a fool The very pet I eat The lamb the Without any cooking I strangle from the teat And swallow the dam As well as the lamb And stop her foolish bleat
Old Hornie too rot him The sire that begot him Shall be among my meat

beast
Were we sent to feast On creatures wild and tame
And shall we reduce The beasts to the use Of vegetable game

Shall animals not Have or pot As in the age of gold
And we claim the right In the pride of our might Themselves to have and hold
O shepherds that keep Your folds full of sheep The wolf was only wrong Because so to speak His jaws were too weak To break your palings strong

Founded upon one of Philibert Hegemon Fables
Edgar put them to The English king Edgar reigned took great pains in hunting and pursuing wolves and says Hume when he found that all that escaped him had taken shelter in the mountains and forests of Wales he changed the tribute of money imposed on the Welsh princes by Athelstan his predecessor into an annual tribute of three hundred heads of wolves which produced such diligence in hunting them that the animal has been no more seen in this island

THE SPIDER AND THE SWALLOW

Jupiter whose fruitful brain By odd obstetrics freed from pain Bore Pallas erst my mortal foe Pray listen to my tale of woe
This Progne takes my lawful prey
As through the air she cuts her way And skims the waves in seeming play
My flies she catches from my door I emphasize the word And but for this accursed bird My net would hold an ample store For I have woven it of stuff To hold the strongest strong enough
was thus in terms of insolence Complain the fretful spider once Of a weaver But then a spinster and deceiver That hoped within her toils to bring Of insects all that ply the wing
The sister swift of Philomel Intent on business prosper well In spite of the complaining pest The insects carried to her nest Nest pitiless to suffering flies Mouths gaping aye to gormandize Of young ones clamouring And stammering With unintelligible cries
The spider with but head and feet
And powerless to compete With wings so fleet Soon saw herself a prey
The swallow passing swiftly by Bore web and all away The spinster dangling in the sky

Two tables hath our Maker set For all that in this world are met
To seats around the first The skilful vigilant and strong are beckon Their hunger and their thirst The rest must quell with leavings at the second

Abstemius
An allusion to the birth of Pallas or Minerva grown and armed from the brain of Jove
Arachne whence the spider has its name was a woman of Colopho who challenged Pallas to a trial of skill in needlework and being defeated hanged herself

THE PARTRIDGE AND THE COCKS

With a set of uncivil and turbulent cocks That deserved for their noise to be put in the stocks A partridge was placed to be rear
Her sex by politeness revered Made her hope from a gentry devoted to love For the courtesy due to the tenderest dove Nay protection chivalric from knights of the yard
That gentry however with little regard For the honours and knighthood wherewith they were deck And for the strange lady as little respect Her ladyship often most horribly peck
At first she was greatly afflicted therefor But when she had noticed these madcaps at war With each other and dealing far bloodier blows Consoling her own individual woes by their customs said she the shame Let us pity the simpletons rather than blame
Our Maker creates not all spirits the same The cocks and the partridges certainly differ By a nature than laws of civility stiffer
Were the choice to be mine I would finish my life In society freer from riot and strife
But the lord of this soil has a different plan His tunnel our race to captivity brings He throws us with cocks after clipping our wings
is little we have to complain of but man

THE DOG WHOSE EARS WERE CROPPED

have I done I like to know To make my master maim me so
A pretty figure I shall cut
From other dogs I keep in kennel shut
Ye kings of beasts or rather tyrants ho
Would any beast have served you so
Thus Growler cried a mastiff young The man whom pity never stung Went on to prune him of his ears
Though Growler whined about his losses He found before the lapse of years Himself a gainer by the process For being by his nature prone To fight his brethren for a bone He oft come back from sad reverse With those appendages the worse
All snarling dogs have ragged ears

The less of hold for teeth of foe The better will the battle go
When in a certain place one fears The chance of being hurt or beat He fortifies it from defeat
Besides the shortness of his ears See Growler arm against his likes With gorget full of ugly spikes
A wolf would find it quite a puzzle To get a hold about his muzzle


THE SHEPHERD AND THE KING

Two demons at their pleasure share our being The cause of Reason from her homestead fleeing No heart but on their altars kindleth flames
If you demand their purposes and names The one is Love the other is Ambition
Of far the greater share this takes possession For even into love it enters Which I might prove but now my story centres Upon a shepherd clothed with lofty powers The tale belongs to older times than ours

A king observed a flock wide spread Upon the plains most admirably fed largely as return the years Their shepherd care by harvests for his shears
Such pleasure in this man the monarch took meritest said he wield a crook higher flock than this and my esteem men now makes thee judge supreme
Behold our shepherd scales in hand Although a hermit and a wolf or two Besides his flock and dogs were all he knew
Well stock with sense all else upon demand Would come of course and did we understand
His neighbour hermit came to him to say I awake
Is this no dream I pray
You favourite
you great
Beware of kings Their favours are but slippery things to mount the heights to which they call Is but to court a more illustrious fall
You little know to what this lure beguiles
My friend I say Beware
The other smiles
The hermit adds how The court has marr your wisdom even now
That purblind traveller I seem to see Who having lost his whip by strange mistake Took for a better one a snake But while he thank his stars brimful of glee Outcried a passenger God shield your breast
Why man for life throw down that treacherous pest That snake
It is my whip
A snake I say What selfish end could prompt my warning pray
Think you to keep your prize
And wherefore not
My whip was worn I found another new This counsel grave from envy springs in you
The stubborn wight would not believe a jot Till warm and lithe the serpent grew And striking with his venom slew The man almost upon the spot
And as to you I dare predict That something worse will soon afflict

What worse than death prophetic hermit
the compound heartache I may term it
And never was there truer prophecy
Full many a courtier pest by many a lie Contrived and many a cruel slander To make the king suspect the judge awry In both ability and candour
Cabals were raised and dark conspiracies Of men that felt aggrieved by his decrees
wealth of ours he hath a palace built Said they
The king astonish at his guilt His riches ask to see
He found but mediocrity Bespeaking strictest honesty
So much for his magnificence
Anon his plunder was a hoard immense Of precious stones that fill an iron box All fast secur by half a score of locks
Himself the coffer oped and sad surprise Befell those manufacturers of lies
The open lid disclosed no other matters Than first a shepherd suit in tatters And then a cap and jacket pipe and crook And scrip mayhap with pebbles from the brook
treasure sweet said he never drew The viper brood of envy lies on you
I take you back and leave this palace splendid As some roused sleeper doth a dream that ended
Forgive me sire this exclamation
In mounting up my fall I had foreseen Yet loved the height too well for who hath been Of mortal race devoid of all ambition

THE FISHES AND THE SHEPHERD WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE

Thrysis who for his Annette dear Made music with his flute and voice Which might have roused the dead to hear And in their silent graves rejoice Sang once the livelong day In the flowery month of May Up and down a meadow brook While Annette fish with line and hook
But a fish would bite So the shepherdess bait Drew not a fish to its fate From morning dawn till night
The shepherd who by his charming songs Had drawn savage beasts to him in throngs And done with them as he pleased to Thought that he could serve the fish so
citizens he sang this water Leave your Naiad in her grot profound Come and see the blue sky lovely daughter Who a thousand times more will charm you Fear not that her prison will harm you Though there you should chance to get bound
is only to us men she is cruel You she will treat kindly A snug little pond she find ye Clearer than a crystal jewel Where you may all live and do well Or if by chance some few Should find their fate Conceal in the bait The happier still are you For envied is the death that met At the hands of sweet Annette
This eloquence not effecting The object of his wishes Since it failed in collecting The deaf and dumb fishes His sweet preaching wasted His honey talk untasted A net the shepherd seized and pouncing With a fell scoop at the scaly fry He caught them and now madly flouncing At the feet of his Annette they lie

O ye shepherds whose sheep men are To trust in reason never dare
The arts of eloquence sublime Are not within your calling Your fish were caught from oldest time By dint of nets and hauling

THE TWO PARROTS THE KING AND HIS SON

Two parrots lived a sire and son On roastings from a royal fire
Two demigods a son and sire These parrots pension for their fun
Time tied the knot of love sincere The sires grew to each other dear The sons in spite of their frivolity Grew comrades boon in joke and jollity At mess they mated hot or cool Were at a school
Which did the bird no little honour since The boy by king begotten was a prince
By nature fond of birds the prince too petted A sparrow which delightfully coquetted
These rivals both of unripe feather One day were frolicking together As oft befalls such little folks A quarrel follow from their jokes
The sparrow quite uncircumspect Was by the parrot sadly peck With drooping wing and bloody head His master pick him up for dead And being quite too wroth to bear it In heat of passion kill his parrot
When this sad piece of news he heard Distracted was the parent bird
His piercing cries bespoke his pain But cries and tears were all in vain
The talking bird had left the shore In short he talking now no more Caused such a rage to seize his sire That lighting on the prince in ire He put out both his eyes And fled for safety as was wise
The bird a pine for refuge chose And to its lofty summit rose There in the bosom of the skies Enjoy his vengeance sweet And scorn the wrath beneath his feet
Out ran the king and cried in soothing tone dear friend what serves it to bemoan
Hate vengeance mourning let us both omit
For me it is no more than fit To own though with an aching heart The wrong is wholly on our part
Th aggressor truly was my son My son
no but by Fate the deed was done
Ere birth of Time stern Destiny Had written down the sad decree That by this sad calamity Your child should cease to live and mine to see

both then cease to mourn And you back to your cage return
king replied the bird you that after such a deed I ought to trust your word
You speak of Fate by such a heathen creed Hope you that I shall be enticed to bleed
But whether Fate or Providence divine Gives law to things below is writ on high that on this waving pine Or where wild forests grow My days I finish safely far From that which ought your love to mar And turn it all to hate
Revenge I know a kingly morsel And ever hath been part and parcel Of this your godlike state
You would forget the cause of grief Suppose I grant you my belief is better still to make it true By keeping out of sight of you
Sire king my friend no longer wait For friendship to be heal
But absence is the cure of hate As is from love the shield

THE LIONESS AND THE BEAR

The lioness had lost her young A hunter stole it from the vale The forests and the mountains rung Responsive to her hideous wail
Nor night nor charms of sweet repose Could still the loud lament that rose From that grim forest queen
No animal as you might think With such a noise could sleep a wink
A bear presumed to intervene
word sweet friend quoth she that is all from me
The young that through your teeth have pass In file unbroken by a fast Had they nor dam nor sire
had them both
I desire Since all their deaths caused no such grievous riot While mothers died of grief beneath your fiat To know why you yourself can not be quiet
quiet I a wretch bereaved
My only son such anguish be relieved
No never
All for me below Is but a life of tears and woe
say why doom yourself to sorrow so

is Destiny that is my foe

Such language since the mortal fall Has fallen from the lips of all
Ye human wretches give your heed For your complaints there little need

THE TWO ADVENTURERS AND THE TALISMAN

No flowery path to glory leads
This truth no better voucher needs Than Hercules of mighty deeds
Few demigods the tomes of fable Reveal to us as being able Such weight of to endure In history I find still fewer
One such however here behold A knight by talisman made bold Within the regions of romance To seek adventures with the lance
There rode a comrade at his ride And as they rode they both espied This writing on a post Wouldst see sir valiant knight A thing whereof the sight No errant yet can boast
Thou hast this torrent but to ford And lifting up alone The elephant of stone Upon its margin shored Upbear it to the mountain brow Round which aloft before thee now The misty chaplets wreathe Not stopping once to breathe
One knight whose nostrils bled Betokening courage fled Cried out if that current sweep Not only rapid be but deep
And grant it cross pray why encumber One arms with that unwieldy lumber An elephant of stone
Perhaps the artist may have done His work in such a way that one Might lug it twice its length But then to reach yon mountain top And that without a breathing stop Were surely past a mortal strength Unless indeed it be no bigger Than some wee pigmy dwarfish figure Which one would head a cane withal And if to this the case should fall The adventurer honour would be small
This posting seems to me a trap Or riddle for some greenish chap I therefore leave the whole to you
The doubtful reasoner onward hies
With heart resolved in spite of eyes The other boldly dashes through Nor depth of flood nor force Can stop his onward course
He finds the elephant of stone He lifts it all alone Without a breathing stop He bears it to the top Of that steep mount and seeth there A city great and fair
the elephant and hush But forth in arms the people rush
A knight less bold had surely fled But he so far from turning back His course right onward sped Resolved himself to make attack And die but with the bravest dead
Amazed was he to hear that band Proclaim him monarch of their land And welcome him in place of one Whose death had left a vacant throne
In sooth he lent a gracious ear Meanwhile expressing modest fear Lest such a load of royal care Should be too great for him to bear
And so exactly Sixtus said When first the pope tiara press his head Though is it such a grievous thing To be a pope or be a king
But days were few before they read it That with but little truth he said it

Blind Fortune follows daring blind
Oft executes the wisest man Ere yet the wisdom of his mind Is task his means or end to scan

THE RABBITS

An Address To The Duke De La Rochefoucauld

While watching man in all his phases And seeing that in many cases He acts just like the brute creation I thought the lord of all these races Of no less failings show the traces Than do his lieges in relation And that in making it Dame Nature Hath put a spice in every creature From off the Not from the immaterial But what we call ethereal Refined from matter rough
An illustration please to hear
Just on the still frontier Of either day or night Or when the lord of light Reclines his radiant head Upon his watery bed Or when he dons the gear To drive a new career While yet with doubtful sway The hour is ruled night and day Some border I climb And acting Jove from height sublime My fatal bolt at will directing I kill some rabbit unsuspecting
The rest that frolick on the heath Or browsed the thyme with dainty teeth With open eye and watchful ear Behold all scampering from beneath Instinct with mortal fear
All frighten simply by the sound Hie to their city underground
But soon the danger is forgot And just as soon the fear lives not The rabbits gayer than before I see beneath my hand once more

Are not mankind well pictured here
By storms asunder driven They scarcely reach their haven And cast their anchor ere They tempt the same dread shocks Of tempests waves and rocks
True rabbits back they frisk To meet the risk

I add another common case
When dogs pass through a place Beyond their customary bounds And meet with others curs or hounds Imagine what a holiday
The native dogs whose interests centre In one great organ term the venter The strangers rush at bite and bay With cynic pertness tease and worry And chase them off their territory
So too do men
Wealth grandeur glory To men of office or profession Of every sort in every nation As tempting are and sweet As is to dogs the refuse meat
With us it is a general fact One sees the attack And plunder to the skin
Coquettes and authors we may view As samples of the sin For woe to belle or writer new
The fewer eaters round the cake The fewer players for the stake The surer each one self to take
A hundred facts my truth might test But shortest works are always best
In this I but pursue the chart Laid down by masters of the art And on the best of themes I hold The truth should never all be told
Hence here my sermon ought to close
O thou to whom my fable owes it has of solid worth Who great by modesty as well as birth Hast ever counted praise a pain Whose leave I could so ill obtain That here your name receiving homage Should save from every sort of damage My slender works which name well known To nations and to ancient Time All France delights to own Herself more rich in names sublime Than any other earthly clime Permit me here the world to teach That you have given my simple rhyme The text from which it dares to preach

THE MERCHANT THE NOBLE THE SHEPHERD AND THE KING SON

Four voyagers to parts unknown On shore not far from naked thrown By furious waves a merchant now undone A noble shepherd and a monarch son Brought to the lot of Belisarius Their wants supplied on alms precarious
To tell what fates and winds and weather Had brought these mortals all together Though from far distant points abscinded Would make my tale
Suffice to say that by a fountain met In council grave these outcasts held debate
The prince enlarged in an oration set Upon the that befall the great
The shepherd deem it best to cast Off thought of all misfortune past And each to do the best he could In efforts for the common weal
ever a repining mood He added misfortune heal
Toil friends will take us back to Rome Or make us here as good a home
A shepherd so to speak
a shepherd
What
As though crown heads were not By Heaven appointment fit The sole receptacles of wit
As though a shepherd could be deeper In thought or knowledge than his sheep are
The three at once approved his plan Wreck as they were on shores American
teach arithmetic the merchant said Its rules of course well seated in his head monthly pay
The prince replied I Will teach political economy
I the noble said heraldry Well versed will open for that branch a school As if beyond a thousand leagues of sea That senseless jargon could befool
friends you talk like men The shepherd cried then The month has thirty days till they are spent Are we upon your faith to keep full Lent
The hope you give is truly good But ere it comes we starve for food

Belisarius was a great general who having commanded the armies of the emperor and lost the favour of his master fell to such a point of destitution that he asked alms upon the La Fontaine

BOOK XI

THE LION

Some time ago a sultan Leopard By means of many a rich escheat Had many an ox in meadow sweet And many a stag in forest fleet And what a savage sort of shepherd
Full many a sheep upon the plains That lay within his wide domains
Not far away one morn There was a lion born
Exchanged high compliments of state As is the custom with the great The sultan call his vizier Fox Who had a deeper And said to him lion whelp you dread What can he do his father being dead
Our pity rather let him share An orphan so beset with care
The luckiest lion ever known If letting conquest quite alone He should have power to keep his own
Sir Renard said And shook his head orphans please your majesty Will get no pity out of me
We ought to keep within his favour Or else with all our might endeavour To thrust him out of life and throne Ere yet his claws and teeth are grown
There not a moment to be lost
His horoscope I cast He never quarrel to his cost But then his friendship fast Will be to friends of greater worth Than any lion on earth
Try then my liege to make it ours Or else to check his rising powers
The warning fell in vain
The sultan slept and beasts and men Did so throughout his whole domain Till lion whelp became a lion
Then came at once the tocsin cry on Alarm and fluttering consternation
The vizier call to consultation A sigh escaped him as he said all this mad excitement now When hope is fled no matter how
A thousand men were useless aid The more the worse since all their power Would be our mutton to devour
Appease this lion sole he doth exceed The helpers all that on us feed
And three hath he that cost him nought His courage strength and watchful thought
Quick send a wether for his use If not contented send him more Yes add an ox and see you choose The best our pastures ever bore
Thus save the rest
But such advice The sultan spurn as cowardice
And his and many states beside Did ills in consequence betide
However fought this world allied The beast maintain his power and pride
If you must let the lion grow Do let him live to be your foe

The fable of the young Leopard in the Bidpaii collection resembles this


THE GODS WISHING TO INSTRUCT A SON OF JUPITER

For Monseigneur The Duke Du Maine

To Jupiter was born a son Who conscious of his origin A godlike spirit had within
To love such age is little prone Yet this celestial boy Made love his chief employ And was beloved wherever known
In him both love and reason Sprang up before their season
With charming smiles and manners winning Had Flora deck his life beginning As an Olympian became Whatever lights the tender flame A heart to take and render bliss Tears sighs in short the whole were his
Jove son he should of course inherit A higher and a nobler spirit Than sons of other deities
It seem as if by Memory aid As if a previous life had made Experiment and hid it He plied the lover trade So perfectly he did it
Still Jupiter would educate In manner fitting to his state
The gods obedient to his call Assemble in their When thus the sire and sole Thus far the boundless universe I roll But numerous other offices there are Of which I give to younger gods the care
I now forecasting for this cherish child Whose countless altars are already piled
To merit such regard from all below All things the young immortal ought to know
No sooner had the ended Than each his godlike plan commended Nor did the boy too little yearn His lesson infinite to learn
Said fiery Mars take the part To make him master of the art Whereby so many heroes high Have won the honours of the sky
teach him music be my care Apollo said the wise and fair mine that mighty god replied In the Nemaean lion hide teach him to subdue The vices an envenom crew Like Hydras springing ever new
The foe of weakening luxury The boy divine will learn from me Those rugged paths so little trod That lead to glory man and god
Said Cupid when it came his turn things from me the boy may learn

Well spoke the god of love
What feat of Mars or Hercules Or bright Apollo lies above Wit wing by a desire to please

The original heading to the fable is For Monseigneur Jupiter was born a Jupiter here is Louis and his son is the Duke du Maine to whom the fable is addressed
The duke was the son of Louis and Madame de Montespan
He was born at Versailles in and when La Fontaine wrote this address to him he was about eight years old and the pupil of Madame de Maintenon his mother successor in the affections of the king


THE FARMER THE DOG AND THE FOX

The wolf and fox are neighbours strange I would not build within their range
The fox once eyed with strict regard From day to day a But though a most accomplish cheat He could not get a fowl to eat
Between the risk and appetite His rogueship trouble was not slight

quoth he stupid rabble But mock me with their constant gabble I go and come and rack my brains And get my labour for my pains
Your rustic owner safe at home Takes all the profits as they come He sells his capons and his chicks Or keeps them hanging on his hook All dress and ready for his cook But I adept in art and tricks Should I but catch the toughest crower Should be brimful of joy and more
O Jove supreme
why was I made A master of the fox trade
By all the higher powers and lower I swear to rob this
Revolving such revenge within When night had still the various din And poppies seem to bear full sway man and dog as lock they lay Alike secure in slumber deep And cocks and hens were fast asleep Upon the populous roost he stole
By negligence a common sin The farmer left unclosed the hole And stooping down the fox went in
The blood of every fowl was spill The citadel with murder fill
The dawn disclosed sad sights I ween When heaps on slaughter heaps were seen All weltering in their mingled gore
With horror stricken as of yore The sun well nigh shrunk back again To hide beneath the liquid main
Such sight once saw the Trojan plain When on the fierce Atrides head Apollo awful anger fell And strew the crimson field with dead Of Greeks scarce one was left to tell The carnage of that night so dread
Such slaughter too around his tent The furious Ajax made one night Of sheep and goats in easy fight In anger blindly confident That by his blows Ulysses fell or some of those By whose iniquity and lies That wily rival took the prize
The fox thus having Ajax play Bore off the nicest of the brood As many pullets as he could And left the rest all prostrate laid
The owner found his sole resource His servants and his dog to curse
useless puppy better drown
Why did you not your sound
did you not the evil shun Quoth Towser you might have done
If you whose interest was more Could sleep and leave an open door Think you that I a dog at best Would watch and lose my precious rest
This pithy speech had been in truth Good logic in a master mouth But coming from a menial lip It even lack the lawyership To save poor Towser from the whip

O thou who a family An honour never grudged by me Thou art a patriarch unwise To sleep and trust another eyes
Thyself shouldst go to bed the last Thy doors all seen to shut and fast
I charge you never let a fox see Your special business done by proxy

Abstemius
Atreus or Atrides king of Mycenae and grandfather of Agamemnon
He caused his brother Theyestes to banquet on the flesh of his own children
After the repast proceeds the story the arms and heads of the murdered children were produced to convince Theyestes of what he had feasted on and at the deed the sun shrunk back in his course


THE MOGUL DREAM

Long since a Mogul saw in dream A vizier in Elysian bliss No higher joy could be or seem Or purer than was ever his
Elsewhere was dream of by the same A wretched hermit wrapp in flame Whose lot touch so pain was he The partners of his misery
Was Minos mock
or had these ghosts By some mistake exchanged their posts
Surprise at this the vision broke The dreamer suddenly awoke
Some mystery suspecting in it He got a wise one to explain it
Replied the sage interpreter not the thing a marvel seem There is a meaning in your dream If I have aught of knowledge sir It covers counsel from the gods
While tenanting these clay abodes This vizier sometimes gladly sought The solitude that favours thought Whereas the hermit in his cot Had longings for a vizier lot
To this interpretation dared I add The love of solitude I would inspire
It satisfies the heart desire With unencumber gifts and glad joys of stingless sweet Aye springing up beneath our feet
O Solitude
whose secret charms I know Retreats that I have loved when shall I go To taste far from a world of din and noise Your shades so fresh where silence has a voice
When shall their soothing gloom my refuge be
When shall the sacred Nine from courts afar And cities with all solitude at war Engross entire and teach their votary The stealthy movements of the spangled nights The names and virtues of those errant lights Which rule human character and fate
Or if not born to purposes so great The streams at least shall win my heartfelt thanks While in my verse I paint their flowery banks
Fate shall not weave my life with golden thread Nor rich on a purple bed Shall I repose full late my head
But will my sleep be less a treasure
Less deep thereby and full of pleasure
I vow it sweet and gentle as the dew Within those deserts sacrifices new And when the time shall come to yield my breath Without remorse I join the ranks of Death

The original story of this fable is traced to Sadi the Persian poet and fabulist who flourished in the twelfth century
La Fontaine probably found it in the French edition of Sadi Gulistan or the Garden of Flowers which was published by André du Ryer in
Chief judge in the infernal regions

THE LION THE MONKEY AND THE TWO ASSES

The lion for his kingdom sake In morals would some lessons take And therefore call one summer day The monkey master of the arts An animal of brilliant parts To hear what he could say
king the monkey thus began reign upon the wisest plan Requires a prince to set his zeal And passion for the public weal Distinctly and quite high above A certain feeling call The parent of all vices In creatures of all sizes
To will this feeling from one breast away Is not the easy labour of a day is much to moderate its tyrant sway
By that your majesty august Will execute your royal trust From folly free and aught unjust
me replied the king of each thing
species said the sage I begin with ours Exalts its own peculiar powers Above sound reason gauge
Meanwhile all other kinds and tribes As fools and blockheads it describes With other compliments as cheap
But on the other hand the same inspires a beast to heap The highest pyramid of fame For every one that bears his name Because he justly deems such praise The easiest way himself to raise
is my conclusion in the case That many a talent here below Is but cabal or sheer grimace The art of seeming things to know An art in which perfection lies More with the ignorant than wise

asses tracking day Of which each in his turn Did incense to the other burn Quite in the usual way I heard one to his comrade say My lord do you not find The prince of knaves and fools To be this man who boasts of mind Instructed in his schools
With wit unseemly and profane He mocks our venerable race On each of his who lacketh brain Bestows our ancient surname ass
And with abusive tongue portraying Describes our laugh and talk as braying
These bipeds of their folly tell us While thus pretending to excel us
No is for you to speak my friend And let their orators attend
The braying is their own but let them be We understand each other and agree And that enough
As for your song Such wonders to its notes belong The nightingale is put to shame And Lambert loses half his fame
My lord the other ass replied Such talents in yourself reside Of asses all the joy and pride
These donkeys not quite satisfied With scratching thus each other hide Must needs the cities visit Their fortunes there to raise By sounding forth the praise Each of the other skill exquisite
Full many in this age of ours Not only among asses But in the higher classes Whom Heaven hath clothed with higher powers Dared they but do it would exalt A simple innocence from fault Or virtue common and domestic To excellence majestic
I said too much perhaps but I suppose Your majesty the secret wo disclose Since was your majesty request that I This matter should exemplify
How love of self gives food to ridicule I shown
To prove the balance of my rule That justice is a sufferer thereby A longer time will take

was thus the monkey spake
But my informant does not state That the sage did demonstrate The other point more delicate
Perhaps he thought none but a fool A lion would too strictly school

This fable is founded upon the Latin proverb asinum
This was Michael Lambert master of to Louis and to the Grand Monarque other great music man J
Lulli who was master


THE WOLF AND THE FOX

Why Aesop gave the palm of cunning flying animals and running To Renard Fox I can not tell Though I have search the subject well
Hath not Sir Wolf an equal skill In tricks and artifices shown When he would do some life an ill Or from his foes defend his own
I think he hath and void of disrespect I might perhaps my master contradict Yet here a case in which the Was palpably I own the brightest dodger
One night he spied within a well Wherein the fullest moonlight fell What seem to him an ample cheese
Two balanced buckets took their turns When drawers thence would fill their urns
Our fox went down in one of these By hunger greatly press to sup And drew the other empty up
Convinced at once of his mistake And anxious for his safety sake He saw his death was near and sure Unless some other wretch in need The same moon image should allure To take a bucket and succeed To his predicament indeed
Two days pass by and none approach the well Unhalting Time as is his wont Was scooping from the moon full front And as he scoop Sir Renard courage fell
His crony wolf of clamorous maw Poor fox at last above him saw And cried comrade look you here
See what abundance of good cheer
A cheese of most delicious zest
Which Faunus must himself have press Of milk by heifer Io given
If Jupiter were sick in heaven The taste would bring his appetite
I taken as you see a bite But still for both there is a plenty
Pray take the bucket that I sent ye Come down and get your share
Although to make the story fair The fox had used his utmost care The wolf a fool to give him credit Went down because his stomach bid it And by his weight pull up Sir Renard to the top
We need not mock this simpleton For we ourselves such deeds have done
Our faith is prone to lend its ear To aught which we desire or fear


THE PEASANT OF THE DANUBE

To judge no man by outside view Is good advice though not quite new
Some time ago a mouse fright Upon this moral shed some light
I have for proof at present With Aesop and good Socrates Of Danube banks a certain peasant Whose portrait drawn to life one sees By Marc Aurelius if you please
The first are well known far and near I briefly sketch the other here
The crop upon his fertile chin Was anything but soft or thin Indeed his person clothed in hair Might personate an unlick bear
Beneath his matted brow there lay An eye that squinted every way A crooked nose and monstrous lips he bore And round his trunk he wore With bulrush belt
And such a man as this is Was delegate from towns the Danube kisses When not a nook on earth there linger By Roman avarice not finger
Before the senate thus he spoke and senators who hear I first of all the gods invoke The powers whom mortals justly fear That from my tongue there may not fall A word which I may need recall
Without their aid there enters nought To human hearts of good or just Whoever leaves the same unsought Is prone to violate his trust The prey of Roman avarice Ourselves are witnesses of this
Rome by our crimes our scourge has grown More than by valour of her own
Romans beware lest Heaven some day Exact for all our groans the pay And arming us by just reverse To do its vengeance stern but meet Shall pour on you the vassal curse And place your necks beneath our feet
And wherefore not
For are you better Than hundreds of the tribes diverse Who clank the galling Roman fetter
What right gives you the universe
Why come and mar our quiet life
We till our acres free from strife In arts our hands were skill to toil As well as the generous soil
What have you taught the Germans brave
Apt scholars had but they Your appetite for sway They might instead of you enslave Without your inhumanity
That which your praetors perpetrate On us as subjects of your state My powers would fail me to relate
Profaned their altars and their rites The pity of your gods our lot excites
Thanks to your representatives In you they see but shameless thieves Who plunder gods as well as men
By sateless avarice insane The men that rule our land from this Are like the bottomless abyss
To satisfy their lust of gain Both man and nature toil in vain
Recall them for indeed we will Our fields for such no longer till
From all our towns and plains we fly For refuge to our mountains high
We quit our homes and tender wives To lead with savage beasts our lives No more to welcome into day A progeny for Rome a prey
And as to those already born Poor helpless babes forlorn We wish them short career in time Your praetors force us to the crime
Are they our teachers
Call them home They teach but luxury and vice Lest Germans should their likes become In fell remorseless avarice
Have we a remedy at Rome
I tell you here how matters go
Hath one no present to bestow No purple for a judge or so The laws for him are deaf and dumb Their minister has aye in store A thousand hindrances or more
I sensible that truths like these Are not the things to please
I done
Let death avenge you here Of my complaint a little too sincere

He said no more but all admired The thought with which his speech was fired The eloquence and heart of oak With which the prostrate savage spoke
Indeed so much were all delighted As due revenge the man was knighted
The praetors were at once displaced And better men the office graced
The senate also by decree Besought a copy of the speech Which might to future speakers be A model for the use of each
Not long had Rome the sense To entertain such eloquence

La Fontaine got the historical story embodied in this fable from Marcus Aurelius as he acknowledges probably through François Cassandre Parallèles Historiques and the translation from the Spanish of Guevara titled the Horloge des Princes which Grise and De Heberay published at Lyons in
Aesop and Socrates are usually represented as very ugly


THE OLD MAN AND THE THREE YOUNG ONES

A man was planting at fourscore
Three striplings who their satchels wore building cried sense were more But then to plant young trees at that age
The man is surely in his dotage
Pray in the name of common sense What fruit can he expect to gather Of all this labour and expense
Why he must live like Lamech father
What use for thee man To load the remnant of thy span With care for days that never can be thine
Thyself to thought of errors past resign
hope and lofty plan Leave thou to us to whom such things belong
you
replied the old man hale and strong dare pronounce you altogether wrong
The settled part of man estate Is very brief and comes full late
To those pale gaming sisters trine Your lives are stakes as well as mine
While so uncertain is the sequel Our terms of future life are equal For none can tell who last shall close his eyes Upon the glories of these azure skies Nor any moment give us ere it flies Assurance that another such shall rise But my descendants they be Shall owe these cooling fruits and shades to me
Do you acquit yourselves in wisdom sight From ministering to other hearts delight
Why boys this is the fruit I gather now And sweeter never blush on bended bough
Of this I may take my fill Indeed I may enjoy its sweetness till I see full many mornings chase the glooms From off the marble of your youthful tombs
The man was right
One of the three Embarking foreign lands to see Was drown within the very port
In quest of dignity at court Another met his country foe And perish by a random blow
The third was kill by falling from a tree Which he himself would graft
The three Were mourn by him of hoary head Who chisel on each monument On doing good intent The things which we have said

THE MICE AND THE OWL

Beware of saying an ear To something marvellous or witty
To disappoint your friends who hear Is possible and were a pity
But now a clear exception see Which I maintain a prodigy A thing which with the air of fable Is true as is the
A pine was by a woodman fell Which ancient huge and hollow tree An owl had for his palace held A bird the Fates had kept in fee Interpreter to such as we
Within the caverns of the pine With other tenants of that mine Were found full many footless mice But well provision fat and nice
The bird had bit off all their feet And fed them there with heaps of wheat
That this owl reason who can doubt
When to the chase he first went out And home alive the vermin brought Which in his talons he had caught The nimble creatures ran away
Next time resolved to make them stay He cropp their legs and found with pleasure That he could eat them at his leisure It were impossible to eat Them all at once did health permit
His foresight equal to our own In furnishing their food was shown
Now let Cartesians if they can Pronounce this owl a mere machine
Could springs originate the plan Of maiming mice when taken lean To fatten for his
If reason did no service there I do not know it anywhere
Observe the course of argument These vermin are no sooner caught than gone They must be used as soon is evident But this to all can not be done
And then for future need I might as well take heed
Hence while their ribs I lard I must from their elopement guard
But how A plan complete I clip them of their feet
Now find me in your human schools A better use of logic tools
Upon your faith what different art of thought Has Aristotle or his followers taught

bird the The owl was the bird of Atropos the most terrible of the Fates to whom was entrusted the task of cutting the thread of life
La Fontaine in a note asserts that the subject of this fable however marvellous was a fact which was actually observed
His commentators however think the observers must have been in some measure mistaken and I agree with Translator
In Fable Book La Fontaine also argues that brutes have reasoning faculties


EPILOGUE

is thus by crystal fount my muse hath sung Translating into heavenly tongue Whatever came within my reach From hosts of beings nature speech
Interpreter of tribes diverse I made them actors on my motley stage For in this boundless universe There none that talketh simpleton or sage More eloquent at home than in my verse
If some should find themselves by me the worse And this my work prove not a model true To that which I at least Succeeding hands will give the finish due
Ye pets of those sweet sisters nine Complete the task that I resign The lessons give which doubtless I omitted With wings by these inventions nicely fitted
But you already more than occupied For while my muse her harmless work hath plied All Europe to our sovereign yields And learns upon her To bow before the noblest plan That ever monarch form or man
Thence draw those sisters themes sublime With power to conquer Fate and Time

Europe to our sovereign An allusion to the conclusion of the peace of Nimeguen by Louis in
Louis to some extent negotiated the treaty of this peace in person and having bought the support of the English king Charles II
as shown in the note to Fable Book VII
the terms of the treaty were almost his own
The glory of the achievement procured for Louis the surname of le Grand
The king praises upon this account are further sounded by La Fontaine in Fable Book XII

With the Epilogue to the XIth Book La Fontaine concluded his issue of Fables up to
The XIIth and last Book was not added till the year before the poet death

BOOK XII

THE COMPANIONS OF ULYSSES

To Monseigneur The Duke De Bourgogne

Dear prince a special favourite of the skies Pray let my incense from your altars rise
With these her gifts if rather late my muse My age and labours must her fault excuse
My spirit wanes while yours beams on the sight At every moment with augmented light It does not go it runs it seems to fly And he from whom it draws its traits so high In war a hero burns to do the same
No lack of his that with victorious force His giant strides mark not his glory course Some god retains our sovereign I might name Himself no less than conqueror divine Whom one short month made master of the Rhine
It needed then upon the foe to dash Perhaps such generalship were rash
But hush they say the Loves and Smiles Abhor a speech spun out in miles And of such deities your court Is constantly composed in short
Not but that other gods as meet There hold the highest seat For free and lawless as the rest may seem Good Sense and Reason bear a sway supreme
Consult these last about the case Of certain men of Grecian race Who most unwise and indiscreet Imbibed such draughts of poison sweet As changed their form and brutified
Ten years the heroes at Ulysses side Had been the sport of wind and tide
At last those powers of water The wanderers bore To that enchanted shore Where Circe reign Apollo daughter
She press upon their thirsty lips Delicious drink but full of bane Their reason at the first light sips Laid down the sceptre of its reign
Then took their forms and features The lineaments of various creatures
To bears and lions some did pass Or elephants of ponderous mass While not a few I ween In smaller forms were seen In such for instance as the mole
Of all the sage Ulysses sole Had wit to shun that treacherous bowl
With wisdom and heroic mien And fine address he caused the queen To swallow on her wizard throne A poison somewhat like her own
A goddess she to speak her wishes dared And hence at once her love declared
Ulysses truly too judicious To lose a moment so propitious Besought that Circe would restore His Greeks the shapes that first they wore
Replied the nymph will they take them back
Go make the proffer to the motley pack
Ulysses ran both glad and sure poisonous cup cried he yet its cure And here I bring what ends your shame and pain
Will you dear friends be men again
Pray speak for speech is now restored
said the lion and he roar head is not so void of brains
Renounce shall I my royal gains
I claws and teeth to tear my foes to bits And more than that I king
Am I such gifts away to fling To be but one of Ithaca mere cits
In rank and file perhaps I might bear arms
In such a change I see no charms
Ulysses passes to the bear changed my friend from what you were
How sightly once
how ugly now

truly how
Growl Bruin in his way else than as a bear should be I pray
Who taught your stilted highness to prefer One form to every other sir
Doth yours possess peculiar powers The merits to decide of ours
With all respect I shall appeal my case To some sweet beauty of the bearish race
Please pass it by if you dislike my face
I live content and free from care And well remembering what we were I say it plain and flat I change to no such state as that
Next to the wolf the princely Greek With flattering hope began to speak I blush I must confess To hear a gentle shepherdess Complaining to the echoing rocks Of that outrageous appetite Which drives you night by night To prey upon her flocks
You had been proud to guard her fold In your more honest life of old
Pray quit this wolfship now you can And leave the woods an honest man
is there one
the wolf replied man I own I never spied
You treat me as a ravenous beast But what are you
To say the least You would yourself have eat the sheep Which eat by me the village weep
Now truly on your faith confess Should I as man love flesh the less
Why man not seldom kills his very brother What then are you but wolves to one another
Now everything with care to scan And rogue with rogue to rate I better be a wolf than man And need not change my state
Thus all did wise Ulysses try And got from all the same reply As well from great as small
Wild liberty was dear to all To follow lawless appetite They counted their supreme delight
All banish from their thought and care The glorious praise of actions fair
Where passion led they thought their course was free their chains they could not see

Prince I had wish for you a theme to choose Where I might mingle pleasantry with use And I should meet with your approving voice No doubt if I could make such choice
At last Ulysses crew Were offer to my view
And there are like them not a few Who may for penalty await Your censure and your hate

THE CAT AND THE TWO SPARROWS

To Monseigneur The Duke De Bourgogne

Contemporary with a sparrow tame There lived a cat from tenderest age Of both the basket and the cage Had household gods the same
The bird sharp beak full oft provoked the cat Who play in turn but with a gentle pat His wee friend sparing with a merry laugh Not punishing his faults by half
In short he scrupled much the harm Should he with points his ferule arm
The sparrow less discreet than he With dagger beak made very free
Sir Cat a person wise and staid Excused the warmth with which he play For is full half of friendship art To take no joke in serious part
Familiar since they saw the light Mere habit kept their friendship good Fair play had never turn to fight Till of their neighbourhood Another sparrow came to greet Old Ratto grave and saucy Pete
Between the birds a quarrel rose And Ratto took his side
pretty stranger with such blows To beat our friend
he cried
neighbour sparrow eating ours
Not so by all the feline powers
And quick the stranger he devours
truly saith Sir Cat I know how sparrows taste by that
Exquisite tender delicate
This thought soon seal the other But hence what moral can I bring
For lacking that important thing A fable lacks its finishing I seem to see of one some trace But still its shadow mocks my chase
Yours prince it will not thus abuse For you such sports and not my muse
In wit she and her sisters eight Would fail to match you with a mate

The story of this fable seems to come from a fable by Furetière titled The Dog and the Cat
Antony Furetière was more famous as a lexicographer and through his angry contention with the French Academy on the subject of his Dictionary than as a poet
He lived between and

THE MISER AND THE MONKEY

A man amass
The thing we know Doth often to a frenzy grow
No thought had he but of his minted gold Stuff void of worth when unemploy I hold
Now that this treasure might the safer be Our miser dwelling had the sea As guard on every side from every thief
With pleasure very small in my belief But very great in his he there Upon his hoard bestow his care
No respite came of everlasting Recounting calculating casting For some mistake would always come To mar and spoil the total sum
A monkey there of goodly size And than his lord I think more wise Some doubloons from the window threw And render thus the count untrue
The padlock room permitted Its owner when he quitted To leave his money on the table
One day bethought this monkey wise To make the whole a sacrifice To Neptune on his throne unstable
I could not well award the prize Between the monkey and the miser pleasure Derived from that devoted treasure
With some Don Bertrand would the honour gain For reasons it were tedious to explain
One day then left alone That animal to mischief prone Coin after coin detach A gold jacobus snatch Or Portuguese doubloon Or silver ducatoon Or noble of the English rose And flung with all his might Those discs which oft excite The strongest wishes mortal ever knows
Had he not heard at last The turning of his master key The money all had pass The same short road to sea And not a single coin but had been pitch Into the gulf by many a wreck enrich

Now God preserve full many a financier Whose use of wealth may find its likeness here

The story is traced to the episode in Tristan romance titled Le Page disgracie treating of The Monkey and Master Robert

THE TWO GOATS

Since goats have browsed by freedom fired To follow fortune they aspired
To pasturage they wont to roam Where men are least disposed to come
If any pathless place there be Or cliff or pendent precipice is there they cut their capers free There nought can stop these dames I Two goats thus The white that on their feet they wore Look back to noble blood of yore Once quit the lowly meadows sated And sought the hills as it would seem In search of luck by luck they met Each other at a mountain stream
As bridge a narrow plank was set On which if truth must be confest Two weasels scarce could go abreast
And then the torrent foaming white As down it tumbled from the height Might well those Amazons affright
But maugre such a fearful rapid Both took the bridge the goats intrepid
I seem to see our Louis Grand And Philip IV
advance To the Isle of Conference That lies Spain and France Each sturdy for his glorious land
Thus each of our adventurers goes Till foot to foot and nose to nose Somewhere about the midst they meet And neither will an inch retreat
For why
they both enjoy the glory Of ancestors in ancient story
The one a goat of peerless rank Which browsing on Sicilian bank The Cyclop gave to Galataea The other famous Amalthaea The goat that suckled Jupiter As some historians aver
For want of giving back in troth A common fall involved them A common accident no doubt On Fortune changeful route

This and several others of the fables in the XIIth Book are taken from the Thèmes of the Duke de Bourgogne afterwards published in Robert Fables Inédites
These Thèmes were the joint composition of Fénélon his pupil the infant Duke de Bourgogne and La Fontaine and were first used in the education of the Duke
Fénélon suggested the story the pupil put it into prose and La Fontaine versified it
La Fontaine is eulogistic of the young Duke wit in putting these Thèmes into prose in Fable Book XII
Louis XIV
See note to Epilogue of Book XI
Isle of The Pheasants Isle in the river Bidassoa which separates France and Spain
It is called the Isle of Conference on account of several of the Conferences leading to Treaties between the two countries having been held there
Cyclop gave to Polyphemus and Galataea Theocritus XI
Another story is that Amalthaea was not a goat but a nymph of Crete who fed the infant Jupiter with goat milk
In the original the last lines differ from those in the version of La Fontaine Oeuvres Posthumes published in the year after the poet death
Indeed variations of text are common to most of the fables of the XIIth Book on making the same comparison of the first edition and the edition in the Oeuvres Posthumes


THE OLD CAT AND THE YOUNG MOUSE

To Monseigneur The Duke De Bourgogne Who Had Requested Of De La Fontaine A Fable Which Should Be Called The Cat And The Mouse

To please a youthful prince whom Fame A temple in my writings vows What fable answers to the name The Cat and Mouse
Shall I in verse the fair present With softest look but hard intent Who serves the hearts her charms entice As does the cat its captive mice
Or make my subject Fortune sport
She treats the friends that make her court And follow closest her advice As treats the cat the silly mice

Shall I for theme a king select Who sole of all her favourites Commands the goddess respect
For whom she from her wheel alights
Who never stay by foes a trice they block his way Can with the strongest play As doth the cat with mice
Insensibly while casting thus about Quite anxious for my subject sake A theme I meet and if I do mistake Shall spoil it too by spinning out
The prince will treat my muse for that As mice are treated by the cat

A young and inexperienced mouse Had faith to try a veteran cat Raminagrobis death to rat And scourge of vermin through the house Appealing to his clemency With reasons sound and fair
let me live a mouse like me It were not much to spare
Am I in such a family A burden
Would my largest wish Our wealthy host impoverish
A grain of wheat will make my meal A nut will fat me like a seal
I lean at present please to wait And for your heirs reserve my fate
The captive mouse thus spake
Replied the captor mistake To me shall such a thing be said
Address the deaf
address the dead
A cat to pardon old one too
Why such a thing I never knew
Thou victim of my paw By law Die as a mousling should And beg the sisterhood Who ply the thread and shears To lend thy speech their ears
Some other like repast My heirs may find or fast
He ceased
The moral plain
Youth always hopes its ends to gain Believes all spirits like its own Old age is not to mercy prone

The story is from Abstemius


THE SICK STAG

A stag where stags abounded Fell sick and was surrounded Forthwith by comrades kind All pressing to assist Or see their friend at least And ease his anxious mind An irksome multitude
sirs
the sick was fain to cry leave me here to die As others do in solitude
Pray let your kind attentions cease Till death my spirit shall release
But comforters are not so sent On duty sad full long intent When Heaven pleased they went But not without a friendly glass That is to say they cropp the grass And leaves which in that quarter grew From which the sick his pittance drew
By kindness thus compell to fast He died for want of food at last
The men take off no trifling dole Who heal the body or the soul
Alas the times
do what we will They have their payment cure or kill

THE BAT THE BUSH AND THE DUCK

A bush duck and bat having found that in trade Confined to their country small profits were made Into partnership enter to traffic abroad Their purse held in common well guarded from fraud
Their factors and agents these trading allies Employ where they needed as cautious as wise Their journals and ledgers exact and discreet Recorded by items expense and receipt
All throve till an argosy on its way home With a cargo worth more than their capital sum In attempting to pass through a dangerous strait Went down with its passengers sailors and freight To enrich those enormous and miserly stores From Tartarus distant but very few doors
Regret was a thing which the firm could but feel Regret was the thing they were slow to reveal For the least of a merchant well knows that the weal Of his credit requires him his loss to conceal
But that which our trio unluckily suffer Allow no repair and of course was discover
No money nor credit was plain to be seen Their heads were now threaten with bonnets of green And the facts of the case being everywhere known No mortal would open his purse with a loan
Debts bailiffs and lawsuits and creditors gruff At the crack of day knocking Importunity shocking
Our trio kept busy enough
The bush ever ready and on the alert Now caught all the people it could by the skirt sir be so good as to tell if you please If you know whereabout the old villanous seas Have hid all our goods which they stole t other night
The diver to seek them went down out of sight
The bat did venture abroad in the day And thus of the bailiffs kept out of the way

Full many insolvents not bats to hide so Nor bushes nor divers I happen to know But even grand seigniors quite free from all cares By virtue of brass and of private backstairs

THE QUARREL OF THE DOGS AND CATS AND THAT OF THE CATS AND MICE

Enthroned by an eternal law Hath Discord reign throughout the universe
In proof I might from this our planet draw A thousand instances diverse
Within the circle of our view This queen hath subjects not a few
Beginning with the elements It is astonishing to see How they have stood to all intents As wrestlers from eternity
Besides these four great potentates Old stubborn earth fire flood and air How many other smaller states Are waging everlasting war
In mansion deck with frieze and column Dwelt dogs and cats in multitudes Decrees promulged in manner solemn Had pacified their ancient feuds
Their lord had so arranged their meals and labours And threaten quarrels with the whip That living in sweet cousinship They edified their wondering neighbours
At last some dainty plate to lick Or profitable bone to pick Bestow by some partiality Broke up the smooth equality
The side neglected were indignant At such a slight malignant
Some writers make the whole dispute begin With favours to a bitch while lying in
the cause the altercation Soon grew a perfect conflagration
In hall and kitchen dog and cat Took sides with zeal for this or that
New rules upon the cat side falling Produced tremendous caterwauling
Their advocate against such rules as these Advised recurrence to the old decrees
They search in vain for hidden in a nook The thievish mice had eaten up the book
Another quarrel in a trice Made many sufferers with the mice For many a veteran With craft and cunning richly stored And grudges old against the race Now watch to put them to the sword Nor mourn for this that mansion lord

Resuming our discourse we see No creature from opponents free
is nature law for earth and sky vain to ask the reason why God works are good I can not doubt it And that is all I know about it
I know however that the cause Which hath our human quarrels brought Three quarters of the time is nought That will be is or ever was
Ye veterans in state and church At threescore years indeed It seems there still is need To give you lessons with the birch


THE WOLF AND THE FOX

Whence comes it that there liveth not A man contented with his lot
Here one who would a soldier be Whom soldiers all with envy see

A fox to be a wolf once sigh
With disappointments mortified Who knows but that his wolfship cheap The wolf himself would be a sheep

I marvel that a prince is able At eight to put the thing in fable While I beneath my seventy snows Forge out with toil and time The same in labour rhyme Less striking than his prose

The traits which in his work we meet A poet it must be confess Could not have half so well express He bears the palm as more complete
is mine to sing it to the pipe But I expect that when the sands Of Time have made my hero ripe He put a trumpet in my hands

My mind but little doth aspire To prophecy but yet it reads On high that soon his glorious deeds Full many Homers will require Of which this age produces few
But bidding mysteries adieu I try my powers upon this fable new

wolf complain a hungry fox lean chick meat or veteran cock Is all I get by toil or trick Of such a living I am sick
With far less risk you better cheer A house you need not venture near But I must do it spite of fear
Pray make me master of your trade
And let me by that means be made The first of all my race that took Fat mutton to his larder hook Your kindness shall not be repented
The wolf quite readily consented
have a brother lately dead Go fit his skin to yours he said
was done and then the wolf proceeded mark you well what must be done The dogs that guard the flock to shun
The fox the lessons strictly heeded
At first he boggled in his dress But awkwardness grew less and less Till perseverance gave success
His education scarce complete A flock his scholarship to greet Came rambling out that way
The wolf his work began Amidst the heedless nibblers ran And spread a sore dismay
Such terror did Patroclus spread When on the Trojan camp and town Clad in Achilles armour dread He valiantly came down
The matrons maids and aged men All hurried to the temples The bleating host now surely thought That fifty wolves were on the spot Dog shepherd sheep all homeward fled And left a single sheep in pawn Which Renard seized when they were gone
But ere upon his prize he fed There crow a cock near by and down The scholar threw his prey and gown That he might run that way the faster Forgetting lessons prize and master
How useless is the art of seeming
Reality in every station Is through its cloak at all times gleaming And bursting out on fit occasion

Young prince to your unrivall wit My muse gives credit as is fit For what she here hath labour with The subject characters and pith

A The infant Duke de Bourgogne
See Note to Table Book XII
The context shows that La Fontaine was over seventy when this fable was written
In the Trojan war when Achilles on his difference with Agamemnon remained inactive in his tent Patroclus his friend put on Achilles armour dread and so caused dire alarm to the Trojans who thought that Achilles had at last taken the field


THE LOBSTER AND HER DAUGHTER

The wise sometimes as lobsters do To gain their ends back foremost go
It is the rower art and those Commanders who mislead their foes Do often seem to aim their sight Just where they do intend to smite
My theme so low may yet apply To one whose fame is very high Who finds it not the hardest matter A league to scatter
What he will do what leave undone Are secrets with unbroken seals Till victory the truth reveals
Whatever he would have unknown Is sought in vain
Decrees of Fate Forbid to check at first the course Which sweeps at last with torrent force
One Jove as ancient fables state Exceeds a hundred gods in weight
So Fate and Louis would seem able The universe to draw Bound captive to their But come we to our fable
A mother lobster did her daughter chide shame my daughter
ca you go ahead
how go you yourself
the child replied I be but by your example led
Head foremost should I singularly wend While all my race pursue the other end
She spoke with sense for better or for worse Example has a universal force
To some it opens wisdom door But leads to folly many more
Yet as for backing to one aim When properly pursued The art is doubtless good At least in grim Bellona game

THE EAGLE AND THE MAGPIE

The eagle through the air a queen And one far different I ween In temper language thought and mien The magpie once a prairie cross
The where they met was drear And Madge gave up herself for lost But having dined on ample cheer The eagle bade her fear You welcome to my company For if the king of gods can be Full oft in need of recreation Who rules the world right well may I Who serve him in that high relation Amuse me then before you fly
Our cackler pleased at quickest rate Of this and that began to prate
Not he of whom old Flaccus writes The most impertinent of wights Or any babbler for that matter Could more incontinently chatter
At last she offer to make known A better spy had never flown All things whatever she might see In travelling from tree to tree
But with her offer little pleased Nay gathering wrath at being teased For such a purpose never rove Replied th impatient bird of Jove
my cackling friend adieu My court is not the place for you Heaven keep it free from such a bore
Madge flapp her wings and said no more

is far less easy than it seems An entrance to the great to gain
The honour oft hath cost extremes Of mortal pain
The craft of spies the tattling art And looks more gracious than the heart Are odious there But still if one would meet success Of different parishes the dress He like the pie must wear

THE KING THE KITE AND THE FALCONER

To His August Highness Monseigneur The Prince De Conti

The gods for that themselves are good The like in mortal monarchs would
The prime of royal rights is grace To this sweet revenge gives place
So thinks your highness while your wrath Its cradle for its coffin hath
Achilles no such conquest knew In this a hero less than you
That name indeed belongs to none Save those who have beneath the sun Their hundred generous actions done
The golden age produced such powers But truly few this age of ours
The men who now the topmost sit Are thank for crimes which they omit
For you unharm by such examples A thousand noble deeds are winning temples Wherein Apollo by the Shall strike your name upon his golden lyre
The gods await you in their azure dome One age must serve for this your lower home
One age entire with you would Hymen dwell O that his sweetest spell For you a destiny may bind By such a period scarce confined
The princess and yourself no less deserve
Her charms as witnesses shall serve As witnesses those talents high Pour on you by the lavish sky Outshining all pretence of peers Throughout your youthful years
A Bourbon seasons grace with wit To that which gains esteem in mixture fit He adds a portion from above Wherewith to waken love
To paint your joy my task is less sublime I therefore turn aside to rhyme What did a certain bird of prey

A kite possessor of a nest antique Was caught alive one day
It was the captor freak That this so rare a bird Should on his sovereign be conferr
The kite presented by the man of chase With due respect before the monarch face If our account is true Immediately flew And perch upon the royal nose
What
on the nose of majesty
Ay on the consecrated nose did he
Had not the king his sceptre and his crown
Why if he had or had not all one The royal nose as if it graced a clown Was seized
The things by courtiers done And said and shriek hopeless to relate
The king in silence sate An outcry from a sovereign king Were quite an unbecoming thing
The bird retain the post where he had fasten No cries nor efforts his departure hasten
His master call as in an agony of pain Presented lure and fist but all in vain
It seem as if the cursed bird With instinct most absurd In spite of all the noise and blows Would roost upon that sacred nose
The urging off of courtiers pages master But roused his will to cling the faster
At last he quit as thus the monarch spoke egress hence imprimis to this kite And next to him who aim at our delight
From each his office we revoke
The one as kite we now discharge The other as a forester at large
As in our station it is fit We do all punishment remit
The court admired
The courtiers praised the deed In which themselves did but so ill Few kings had taken such a course
The fowler might have fared far worse His only crime as of his kite Consisted in his want of light About the danger there might be In coming near to royalty
Forsooth their scope had wholly been Within the woods
Was that a sin By Pilpay this remarkable affair Is placed beside the Ganges flood
No human creature ventures there To shed of animals the blood The deed not even royalty would dare
we they say both lord and liege bird saw not the Trojan siege
Perhaps a hero part he bore And there the highest helmet wore
What once he was he yet may be
Taught by Pythagoras are we That we our forms with animals exchange We kites or pigeons for a while Then biped plodders on the soil And then As volatile again The liquid air we Now since two versions of this tale exist I give the other if you list
A certain falconer had caught A kite and for his sovereign thought The bird a present rich and rare
It may be once a century Such game is taken from the air For is the pink of falconry
The captor pierced the courtier crowd With zeal and sweat as if for life Of such a princely present proud His hopes of fortune sprang full rife When slap the savage made him feel His talons newly arm with steel By perching on his nasal member As if it had been senseless timber
Outshriek the wight but peals of laughter Which threaten ceiling roof and rafter From courtier page and monarch broke Who had not laugh at such a joke
From me so prone am I to such a sin An empire had not held me in
I dare not say that had the pope been there He would have join the laugh sonorous But sad the king I hold who should not dare To lead for such a cause in such a chorus
The gods are laughers
Spite of ebon brows Jove joints the laugh which he allows
As history saith the thunderer laugh went up When limping Vulcan served the nectar cup
Whether or not immortals here are wise Good sense I think in my digression lies
For since the moral what we have in view What could the falconer fate have taught us new
Who does not notice in the course of things More foolish falconers than indulgent kings

THE FOX THE FLIES AND THE HEDGEHOG

A fox old subtle vigilant and sly By hunters wounded fallen in the mud Attracted by the traces of his blood That buzzing parasite the fly
He blamed the gods and wonder why The Fates so cruelly should wish To feast the fly on such a costly dish

light on me
make me its food
Me me the nimblest of the wood
How long has been so good
What serves my tail
Is it a useless weight
Go Heaven confound thee greedy reprobate And suck thy fill from some more vulgar veins
A hedgehog witnessing his pains This fretful personage Here graces first my page Desired to set him free From such cupidity
neighbour fox said he My quills these rascals shall empale And ease thy torments without fail
for the world my friend
the fox replied
let them finish their repast
These flies are full
Should they be set aside New hungrier swarms would finish me at last

LOVE AND FOLLY

Love bears a world of mystery His arrows quiver torch and infancy is not a trifling work to sound A sea of science so profound And hence t explain it all Is not my aim but in my simple way To show how that blind archer lad And he a god
came by the loss of sight And eke what consequence the evil had Or good perhaps if named aright A point I leave the lover to decide As fittest judge who hath the matter tried
Together on a certain day Said Love and Folly were at play The former yet enjoy his eyes
Dispute arose
Love thought it wise Before the council of the gods to go Where both of them by birth held stations But Folly in her lack of patience Dealt on his forehead such a blow As seal his orbs to all the light of heaven
Now Venus claim that vengeance should be given
And by what force of tears yourselves may guess The woman and the mother sought redress
The gods were deafen with her cries Jove Nemesis the stern assize Of Orcus all the gods in short From whom she might the boon extort
The enormous wrong she well portray Her son a wretched groper made An ugly staff his steps to aid
For such a crime it would appear No punishment could be severe The damage too must be repair
The case maturely weigh and cast The public weal with private squared Poor Folly was condemn at last By judgment of the court above To serve for aye as guide to Love

THE RAVEN THE GAZELLE THE TORTOISE AND THE RAT

To Madame De La Sablière

A temple I reserved you in my rhyme It might not be completed but with time
Already its endurance I had grounded Upon this charming art divinely founded And on the name of that divinity For whom its adoration was to be
These words I should have written its gate TO IRIS IS THIS PALACE CONSECRATE Not her who served the queen divine For Juno self and he who crown her bliss Had thought it for their dignity I wis To bear the messages of mine
Within the dome the apotheosis Should greet th enraptured sight All heaven in pomp and order meet Conducting Iris to her seat Beneath a canopy of light
The walls would amply serve to paint her life A matter sweet indeed but little rife In those events which order by the Fates Cause birth or change or overthrow of states
The innermost should hold her image Her features smiles attractions there Her art of pleasing without care Her loveliness that sure of homage
Some mortals kneeling at her feet Earth noblest heroes should be seen Ay demigods and even gods I ween The worshipp of the world thinks meet Sometimes her altar to perfume
Her eyes so far as that might be Her soul rich jewel should illume Alas
but how imperfectly
For could a heart that throbb to bless Its friends with boundless tenderness Or could that mind Which in its matchless beauty join The strength of man with woman grace Be given to sculptor to express
O Iris who canst charm the soul Nay bind it with supreme control Whom as myself I can but love Nay not that word as I a man Your court has placed it under ban And we dismiss it pray approve My filling up this hasty plan
This sketch has here received a place A simple anecdote to grace Where friendship shows so sweet a face That in its features you may find Somewhat accordant to your mind
Not that the tale may kings beseem But he who winneth your esteem Is not a monarch placed above The need and influence of love But simple mortal void of crown That would for friends his life lay down Than which I know no friendlier act
Four animals in league compact Are now to give our noble race A useful lesson in the case

Rat raven tortoise and gazelle Once into firmest friendship fell
was in a home unknown to man That they their happiness began
But safe from man there no retreat Pierce you the loneliest wood Or dive beneath the deepest flood Or mount you where the eagles brood His secret ambuscade you meet
The light gazelle in harmless play Amused herself abroad one day When by mischance her track was found And follow by the baying hound That barbarous tool of barbarous man From which far far away she ran
At to the others The rat observed brothers How happens it that we Are met but three
Is Miss Gazelle so little steady
Hath she forgotten us already
Out cried the tortoise at the word I as Raven is a bird I fly this instant from my seat And learn what accident and where Hath kept away our sister fair Our sister of the flying feet For of her heart dear rat It were a shame to doubt of that
The raven flew He spied afar the face he knew The poor gazelle entangled in a snare In anguish vainly floundering there
Straight back he turn and gave the alarm For to have ask the sufferer now The why and wherefore when and how She had incurr so great a harm And lose in vain debate The of fate As would the master of a school He was by no means such a fool
On tidings of so sad a pith The three their council held forthwith
By two it was the vote To hasten to the spot Where lay the poor gazelle
friend here in his shell I think will do as well To guard the house the raven said with his creeping pace When would he reach the place
Not till the deer were dead
Eschewing more debate They flew to aid their mate That luckless mountain roe
The tortoise too resolved to go
Behold him plodding on behind And plainly cursing in his mind The fate that left his legs to lack And glued his dwelling to his back
The snare was cut by Rongemail For so the rat they rightly hail
Conceive their joy yourself you may
Just then the hunter came that way And hath filch my prey
Cried he upon the spot Where now his prey was A hole hid Rongemail A tree the bird as well The woods the free gazelle
The hunter well nigh mad To find no inkling could be had Espied the tortoise in his path And straightway check his wrath
let my courage flag Because my snare has chanced to miss
I have a supper out of this
He said and put it in his bag
And it had paid the forfeit so Had not the raven told the roe Who from her covert came Pretending to be lame
The man right eager to pursue Aside his wallet threw Which Rongemail took care To serve as he had done the snare Thus putting to an end The hunter supper on his friend
is thus sage Pilpay tale I follow
Were I the ward of Apollo It were by favour of that god easy And surely for your sake As long a tale to make As is the Iliad or Odyssey
Grey Rongemail the hero part should play Though each would be as needful in his way
He of the mansion portable awoke Sir Raven by the words he spoke To act the spy and then the swift express
The light gazelle alone had had th address The hunter to engage and furnish time For Rongemail to do his deed sublime
Thus each his part perform
Which wins the prize
The heart so far as in my judgment lies

THE WOODS AND THE WOODMAN

A certain lost or broke From his axe eye a bit of oak
The forest must needs be somewhat spared While such a loss was being repair
Came the man at last and humbly pray That the woods would kindly lend to him A moderate loan a single limb Whereof might another helve be made And his axe should elsewhere drive its trade
O the oaks and firs that then might stand A pride and a joy throughout the land For their ancientness and glorious charms
The innocent Forest lent him arms But bitter indeed was her regret For the wretch his axe and whet Did nought but his benefactress spoil Of the finest trees that graced her soil And ceaselessly was she made to groan Doing penance for that fatal loan

Behold the and its actors Where benefits hurt benefactors A weary theme and full of pain For where the shade so cool and sweet Protecting strangers from the heat But might of such a wrong complain
Alas
I vex myself in vain Ingratitude do what I will Is sure to be the fashion still

THE FOX THE WOLF AND THE HORSE

A fox though young by no means raw Had seen a horse the first he ever saw
neighbour wolf said he to one quite green creature in our meadow I have seen Sleek grand
I seem to see him yet The finest beast I ever met
he a stouter one than we
The wolf demanded eagerly picture of him let me see
I could paint said fox should delight T anticipate your pleasure at the sight But come who knows
perhaps it is a prey By fortune offer in our way
They went
The horse turn loose to graze Not liking much their looks or ways Was just about to gallop off
said the fox humble servants we Make bold to ask you what your name may be
The horse an animal with brains enough Replied you yourselves may read my name My shoer round my heel hath writ the same
The fox excus himself for want of knowledge sir my parents did not educate So poor a hole was their entire estate
My friend the wolf however taught at college Could read it were it even Greek
The wolf to flattery weak Approach to verify the boast For which four teeth he lost
The high raised hoof came down with such a blow As laid him bleeding on the ground full low
brother said the fox shows how just What once was taught me by a fox of wit Which on thy jaws this animal hath writ All unknown things the wise mistrust

THE FOX AND THE TURKEYS

Against a robber fox a tree Some turkeys served as citadel
That villain much provoked to see Each standing there as sentinel Cried out witless birds At me stretch out their necks and gobble
No by the powers
I give them trouble
He verified his words
The moon that shined full on the oak Seem then to help the turkey folk
But fox in arts of siege well versed Ransack his bag of tricks accursed
He feign himself about to climb Walk on his hinder legs sublime Then death most aptly counterfeited And seem anon resuscitated
A practiser of wizard arts Could not have fill so many parts
In moonlight he contrived to raise His tail and make it seem a blaze And countless other tricks like that
Meanwhile no turkey slept or sat
Their constant vigilance at length As hoped the fox wore out their strength
Bewilder by the rigs he run They lost their balance one by one
As Renard slew he laid aside Till nearly half of them had died Then proudly to his larder bore And laid them up an ample store

A foe by being Has often in his plan succeeded


THE APE

There is an ape in Paris To which was given a wife Like many a one that marries This ape in brutal strife Soon beat her out of life
Their infant cries perhaps not fed But cries I ween in vain The father laughs his wife is dead And he has other loves again Which he will also beat I think Return from tavern drown in drink

For aught that good you need not look Among the imitative tribe A monkey be it or what makes a book The worse I deem the aping scribe


THE SCYTHIAN PHILOSOPHER

A Scythian philosopher austere Resolved his rigid life somewhat to cheer Perform the tour of Greece saw many things But best a sage one such as Virgil sings A simple rustic man that equal kings From whom the gods would hardly bear the palm Like them unawed content and calm
His fortune was a little nook of land And there the Scythian found him hook in hand His pruning
Here he cropp A barren branch there slash and lopp Correcting Nature everywhere Who paid with usury his care
why this wasteful havoc sir
So spoke the wondering traveller it I ask in reason name Be wise these harmless trees to maim
Fling down that instrument of crime And leave them to the scythe of Time
Full soon unhasten they will go To deck the banks of streams below
Replied the tranquil gardener humbly crave your pardon sir Excess is all my hook removes By which the rest more fruitful proves
The philosophic traveller Once more within his country cold Himself of laid hold And made a use most free and bold Prescribed to friends and counsel neighbours To imitate his pruning labours
The finest limbs he did not spare But pruned his orchard past all reason Regarding neither time nor season Nor taking of the moon a care
All wither droop and died

This Scythian I set beside The indiscriminating Stoic
The latter with a blade heroic Retrenches from his spirit sad Desires and passions good and bad Not sparing a harmless wish
Against a tribe so Vandalish With earnestness I here protest
They maim our hearts they stupefy Their strongest springs if not their best They make us cease to live before we die


THE ELEPHANT AND THE APE OF JUPITER

elephant and beast of horned nose About precedence a dispute arose Which they determined to decide by blows
The day was fix when came a messenger To say the ape of Jupiter Was swiftly earthward seen to bear His bright caduceus through the air
This monkey named in history Gill The elephant at once believed A high commission had received To witness by his sovereign will The aforesaid battle fought
Uplifted by the glorious thought The beast was prompt on Monsieur Gill to wait But found him slow in usual forms of state His high credentials to present
The ape however ere he went Bestow a passing salutation
His excellency would have heard The subject matter of legation But not a word
His fight so far from stirring heaven The news was not received there even
What difference sees the impartial sky Between an elephant and fly
Our monarch doting on his object Was forced himself to break the subject
cousin Jupiter said he shortly from his throne supreme A most important combat see For all his court a thrilling theme
combat
said the ape with serious face
possible you should not know the case The elephant exclaim know dear sir That Lord Rhinoceros disputes With me precedence of the brutes
That Elephantis is at war With savage hosts of Rhinocer
You know these realms not void of fame
joy to learn them now by name Return Sir Gill first or last No lisp of them has ever pass Throughout our dome so blue and vast
Abash the elephant replied came you then to do two emmets to divide A spire of grass in two
We take of all a care And as to your affair Before the gods who view with equal eyes The small and great it hath not chanced to rise


THE FOOL AND THE SAGE

A fool pursued with club and stone A sage who said friend well done
Receive this guinea for your pains They well deserve far higher gains
The workman worthy of his hire is said
There comes a wealthy squire Who hath wherewith thy works to pay To him direct thy gifts and they Shall gain their proper recompense
Urged by the hope of gain Upon the wealthy citizen The fool repeated the offence
His pay this time was not in gold
Upon the witless man A score of ready footmen ran And on his back in full his wages told
In courts such fools afflict the wise They raise the laugh at your expense
To check their babble were it sense Their folly meetly to chastise
Perhaps take a stronger man
Then make them worry one who can

THE ENGLISH FOX

To Madame Harvey

Sound reason and a tender heart With thee are friends that never part
A hundred traits might swell the roll Suffice to name thy nobleness of soul Thy power to guide both men and things Thy temper open bland and free A gift that draweth friends to thee To which thy firm affection clings Unmarr by age or change of clime Or tempests of this stormy time All which deserve in highest lyric A rich and lofty panegyric But no such thing wouldst thou desire Whom pomp displeases praises tire
Hence mine is simple short and plain Yet madam I would fain Tack on a word or two Of homage to your country due A country well beloved by you

With mind to match the outward case The English are a thinking race
They pierce all subjects through and through Well arm with facts they hew their way And give to science boundless sway
Quite free from flattery I say Your countrymen for penetration Must bear the palm from every nation For the dogs they breed excel Our own in nicety of smell
Your foxes too are cunninger As readily we may infer From one that practised is believed A stratagem the best conceived
The wretch once in the utmost strait By dogs of nose so delicate Approach a gallows where A lesson to like passengers Or clothed in feathers or in furs Some badgers owls and foxes pendent were
Their comrade in his pressing need Arranged himself among the dead
I seem to see old Hannibal Outwit some Roman general And sit securely in his tent The legions on some other scent
But certain dogs kept back To tell the errors of the pack Arriving where the traitor hung A fault in fullest chorus sung
Though by their bark the welkin rung Their master made them hold the tongue
Suspecting not a trick so odd Said he rogue beneath the sod
My dogs that never saw such jokes Wo bark beyond these honest folks

The rogue would try the trick again
He did so to his cost and pain
Again with dogs the welkin rings Again our fox from gallows swings But though he hangs with greater faith This time he does it to his death
So uniformly is it true A stratagem is best when new
The hunter had himself been hunted So apt a trick had not invented Not that his wit had been deficient With that it can not be denied Your English folks are But wanting love of life sufficient Full many an Englishman has died
One word to you and I must quit My subject A long eulogium is a project For which my lyre is all unfit
The song or verse is truly rare Which can its meed of incense bear And yet amuse the general ear Or wing its way to lands afar
Your prince once told you I have heard An able judge as rumour says That he one dash of love preferr To all a sheet could hold of praise
Accept is all I crave the offering Which here my muse has dared to bring Her last perhaps of earthly acts She blushes at its sad defects
Still by your favour of my rhyme Might not the homage please the while The dame who fills your northern clime With wingèd emigrants sublime From Cytherea isle
By this you understand I mean Love guardian goddess Mazarin

THE SUN AND THE FROGS

Long from the monarch of the stars The daughters of the mud received Support and aid nor dearth nor wars Meanwhile their teeming nation grieved
They spread their empire far and wide Through every marsh by every tide
The queens of swamps I mean no more Than simply frogs great names are cheap Caball together on the shore And cursed their patron from the deep And came to be a perfect bore
Pride rashness and ingratitude The progeny of fortune good Soon brought them to a bitter cry The end of sleep for earth and sky
Their clamours if they did not craze Would truly seem enough to raise All living things to mutiny Against the power of Nature eye
The sun according to their croak Was turning all the world to smoke
It now behoved to take alarm And promptly powerful troops to arm
Forthwith in haste they sent Their croaking embassies To all their states they went And all their colonies
To hear them talk the all That rides upon this whirling ball Of men and things was left at stake Upon the mud that skirts a lake
The same complaint in fens and bogs Still ever strains their lungs And yet these frogs Had better hold their tongues For should the sun in anger rise And hurl his vengeance from the skies That kingless crew Their impudence would sorely rue

Phaedrus
Fable Book gives another version of the same story
This fable has reference to the current troubles between France and the Dutch
Louis XIV
is the sun
He had adopted the sun as his emblem


THE LEAGUE OF THE RATS

A mouse was once in mortal fear Of a cat that watch her portal near
What could be done in such a case
With prudent care she left the catship And courted with a humble grace A neighbour of a higher race Whose lordship I should say his ratship Lay in a great hotel And who had boasted oft is said Of living wholly without dread
said this braggart Dame Mouse what should I do
Alone I can not rout The foe that threatens you
I rally all the rats about And then I play him such a trick
The mouse her dropp And off the hero scamper quick Nor till he reach the buttery stopp Where scores of rats were clustered In riotous extravagance All feasting at the host expense
To him arriving there much flustered Indeed quite out of breath A rat among the feasters saith news
what news
I pray you speak
The rat recovering breath to squeak Replied tell the matter in a trice It is that we must promptly aid the mice For old Raminagrab is making Among their ranks a dreadful quaking
This cat of cats the very devil When mice are gone will do us evil
true said each and all arms
to arms
they cry and call
Some ratties by their fears Were melted to tears
It matter not a whisk Nor check the valour brisk
Each took upon his back Some cheese in haversack And roundly swore to risk His carcass in the cause
They march as to a feast Not flinching in the But quite too late for in his jaws The cat already held the mouse
They rapidly approach the house To save their friend beyond a doubt
Just then the cat came growling out The mouse beneath his whisker nose
And march along before his foes
At such a voice our rats discreet Foreboding a defeat Effected in a style most fleet A fortunate retreat
Back hurried to his hole each rat And afterwards took care to shun the cat


DAPHNIS AND ALCIMADURE

An Imitation Of Theocritus

To Madame De La Mésangère

Offspring of her to whom While from thy lovely self away A thousand hearts their homage pay Besides the throngs whom friendship binds to please And some whom love presents thee on their knees
A mandate which I can not thrust aside Between you both impels me to divide Some of the incense which the dews distil Upon the roses of a sacred hill And which by secret of my trade Is sweet and most delicious made
To you I say but all to say Would task me far beyond my day I need judiciously to choose Thus husbanding my voice and muse Whose strength and leisure soon would fail
I only praise your tender heart and hale Exalted feelings wit and grace In which there none can claim a higher place Excepting her whose praise is your entail
Let not too many thorns forbid to touch These roses I may call them such If Love should ever say as much
By him it will be better said indeed And they who his advices will not heed Scourge fearfully will he As you shall shortly see

A blooming miracle of yore Despised his godship sovereign power They call her name Alcimadure
A haughty creature fierce and wild She sported Nature tameless child
Rough paths her wayward feet would lead To darkest glens of mossy trees Or she would dance on daisied mead With nought of law but her caprice
A fairer could not be Nor crueller than she
Still charming in her sternest mien when her haughty look debarr What had she been to lover in The fortress of her kind regard
Daphnis a shepherd swain Had loved this maiden to his bane
Not one regardful look or smile Nor a gracious word the while Relieved the fierceness of his pain
with a suit so vain His hope was but to die No power had he to fly
He sought impell by dark despair The portals of the cruel fair
Alas
the winds his only listeners were
The mistress gave no entrance there No entrance to the palace where Ingrate against her natal day She join the treasures sweet and gay In garden or in grown To blooming beauty all her own
hoped he cried your eyes I should have died But ah
too deeply I have won your hate Nor should it be surprising news To me that you should now refuse To lighten thus my cruel fate
My sire when I shall be no more Is charged to lay your feet before The heritage your heart neglected
With this my pasturage shall be connected My trusty dog and all that he protected And of my goods which then remain My mourning friends shall rear a fane
There shall your image stand midst rosy bowers Reviving through the ceaseless hours An altar built of living flowers
Near by my simple monument Shall this short epitaph present Here Daphnis died of love
Stop passenger And say thou with a falling tear This youth here fell unable to endure The ban of proud Alcimadure

He would have added but his heart Now felt the last the fatal dart
Forth march the maid in triumph deck And of his murder little reck
In vain her steps her own attendants check And plead That she at least should shed Upon her lover dead Some tears of due respect
The rosy god of Cytherea born She ever treated with the deepest scorn Contemning him his laws and means of damage She drew her train to dance around his image When woful to relate The statue fell and crush her with its weight
A voice forth issued from a cloud And echo bore the words aloud Throughout the air wide spread Let all now love the insensible is dead
Meanwhile down to the Stygian tide The shade of Daphnis hied And quaked and wonder there to meet The maid a ghostess at his feet
All Erebus awaken wide To hear that beauteous homicide Beg pardon of the swain who died For being deaf to love confess As was Ulysses to the prayer Of Ajax begging him to spare Or as was Dido faithless guest

Theocritus Idyl xxiii
de la This lady was the daughter of Madame de la Translator
She was the lady termed La Marquise with whom Fontenelle sustained his imaginary conversation in the Plurality of Worlds a book which became very popular both in France and England
faithless Aeneas with whom Dido according to Virgil and Ovid was in love but who loved not and sailed away


THE ARBITER THE ALMONER AND THE HERMIT

Three saints for their salvation jealous Pursued with hearts alike most zealous By routes diverse their common aim
All highways lead to Rome the same Of heaven our rivals deeming true Each chose alone his pathway to pursue
Moved by the cares delays and crosses Attach to suits by legal process One gave himself as judge without reward For earthly fortune having small regard
Since there are laws to legal strife Man damns himself for half his life
For half perhaps the whole
The hope possess our umpire soul That on his plan he should be able To cure this vice The second chose the hospitals
I give him praise to solace pain Is charity not spent in vain While men in part are animals
The sick for things went then as now they go Gave trouble to the almoner I trow
Impatient sour complaining ever As rack by rheum or parch with fever favourites are such and such With them he watches And lets us die they say Such sore complaints from day to day Were nought to those that did await The reconciler of debate
His judgments suited neither side Forsooth in either party view He never held the balance true But swerved in every cause he tried

Discouraged by such speech the arbiter Betook himself to see the almoner
As both received but murmurs for their fees They both retired in not the best of moods To break their troubles to the silent woods And hold communion with the ancient trees
There underneath a rugged mountain Beside a clear and silent fountain A place revered by winds to sun unknown They found the other saint who lived alone
Forthwith they ask his sage advice
own he answer suffice Who but yourselves your wants should know
To know one self is here below The first command of the Supreme
Have you obey among the bustling throngs
Such knowledge to tranquillity belongs Elsewhere to seek were fallacy extreme
Disturb the water do you see your face
See we ourselves within a troubled breast
A murky cloud in such a case Though once it were a crystal vase
But brothers let it simply rest And each shall see his features there impress
For inward thought a desert home is best

Such was the hermit answer brief And happily it gain belief

But business still from life must not be stricken Since men will doubtless sue at law and sicken Physicians there must be and advocates Whereof thank God no lack the world awaits While wealth and honours are the baits
Yet in the stream of common wants when thrown What busy mortal but forgets his own
O you who give the public all your care Be it as judge or prince or minister Disturb by countless accidents most sinister By adverse gales abased debased by fair Yourself you never see nor you aught
Comes there a moment rest for serious thought There comes a flatterer too and brings it all to nought
This lesson seals our varied page O may it teach from age to age
To kings I give it to the wise propose Where could my labours better close

This fable was first printed in the Recueil de vers choisis du Bouhours published in and afterwards given as the last of La Fontaine Book XII
