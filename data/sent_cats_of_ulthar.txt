it is said that in ulthar which lies beyond the river skai no man may kill a cat and this i can verily believe as i gaze upon him who sitteth purring before the fire
for the cat is cryptic and close to strange things which men cannot see
he is the soul of antique aegyptus and bearer of tales from forgotten cities in meroe and ophir
he is the kin of the jungle s lords and heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister africa
the sphinx is his cousin and he speaks her language but he is more ancient than the sphinx and remembers that which she hath forgotten
in ulthar before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats there dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats of their neighbours
why they did this i know not save that many hate the voice of the cat in the night and take it ill that cats should run stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight
but whatever the reason this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and slaying every cat which came near to their hovel and from some of the sounds heard after dark many villagers fancied that the manner of slaying was exceedingly peculiar
but the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man and his wife because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of the two and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard
in truth much as the owners of cats hated these odd folk they feared them more and instead of berating them as brutal assassins merely took care that no cherished pet or mouser should stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees
when through some unavoidable oversight a cat was missed and sounds heard after dark the loser would lament impotently or console himself by thanking fate that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished
for the people of ulthar were simple and knew not whence it is all cats first came
one day a caravan of strange wanderers from the south entered the narrow cobbled streets of ulthar
dark wanderers they were and unlike the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year
in the market place they told fortunes for silver and bought gay beads from the merchants
what was the land of these wanderers none could tell but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers and that they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with human bodies and the heads of cats hawks rams and lions
and the leader of the caravan wore a head dress with two horns and a curious disc betwixt the horns
there was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or mother but only a tiny black kitten to cherish
the plague had not been kind to him yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate his sorrow and when one is very young one can find great relief in the lively antics of a black kitten
so the boy whom the dark people called menes smiled more often than he wept as he sate playing with his graceful kitten on the steps of an oddly painted wagon
on the third morning of the wanderers stay in ulthar menes could not find his kitten and as he sobbed aloud in the market place certain villagers told him of the old man and his wife and of sounds heard in the night
and when he heard these things his sobbing gave place to meditation and finally to prayer
he stretched out his arms toward the sun and prayed in a tongue no villager could understand though indeed the villagers did not try very hard to understand since their attention was mostly taken up by the sky and the odd shapes the clouds were assuming
it was very peculiar but as the little boy uttered his petition there seemed to form overhead the shadowy nebulous figures of exotic things of hybrid creatures crowned with horn flanked discs
nature is full of such illusions to impress the imaginative
that night the wanderers left ulthar and were never seen again
and the householders were troubled when they noticed that in all the village there was not a cat to be found
from each hearth the familiar cat had vanished cats large and small black grey striped yellow and white
old kranon the burgomaster swore that the dark folk had taken the cats away in revenge for the killing of menes kitten and cursed the caravan and the little boy
but nith the lean notary declared that the old cotter and his wife were more likely persons to suspect for their hatred of cats was notorious and increasingly bold
still no one durst complain to the sinister couple even when little atal the innkeeper s son vowed that he had at twilight seen all the cats of ulthar in that accursed yard under the trees pacing very slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage two abreast as if in performance of some unheard of rite of beasts
the villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy and though they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death they preferred not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yard
so ulthar went to sleep in vain anger and when the people awaked at dawn behold
every cat was back at his accustomed hearth
large and small black grey striped yellow and white none was missing
very sleek and fat did the cats appear and sonorous with purring content
the citizens talked with one another of the affair and marvelled not a little
old kranon again insisted that it was the dark folk who had taken them since cats did not return alive from the cottage of the ancient man and his wife
but all agreed on one thing that the refusal of all the cats to eat their portions of meat or drink their saucers of milk was exceedingly curious
and for two whole days the sleek lazy cats of ulthar would touch no food but only doze by the fire or in the sun
it was fully a week before the villagers noticed that no lights were appearing at dusk in the windows of the cottage under the trees
then the lean nith remarked that no one had seen the old man or his wife since the night the cats were away
in another week the burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely silent dwelling as a matter of duty though in so doing he was careful to take with him shang the blacksmith and thul the cutter of stone as witnesses
and when they had broken down the frail door they found only this two cleanly picked human skeletons on the earthen floor and a number of singular beetles crawling in the shadowy corners
there was subsequently much talk among the burgesses of ulthar
zath the coroner disputed at length with nith the lean notary and kranon and shang and thul were overwhelmed with questions
even little atal the innkeeper s son was closely questioned and given a sweetmeat as reward
they talked of the old cotter and his wife of the caravan of dark wanderers of small menes and his black kitten of the prayer of menes and of the sky during that prayer of the doings of the cats on the night the caravan left and of what was later found in the cottage under the dark trees in the repellent yard
and in the end the burgesses passed that remarkable law which is told of by traders in hatheg and discussed by travellers in nir namely that in ulthar no man may kill a cat
